	abstract = {In the ten years since the first edition of this book appeared the field of mathematical biology has grown at an astonishing rate and has established itself as a distinct discipline. Mathematical modelling is now being applied in every major discipline in the biomedical sciences. Though the field has become increasingly large and specialized, this book remains important as a text that introduces some of the exciting problems that arise in biology and gives some indication of the wide spectrum of questions that modelling can address. Due to this tremendous development in recent years, for this new edition Murray is covering certain items in depth, giving new applications such as modelling marital interaction, growth of cancer tumours, temperature sex determination, wolf territoriality, wolf-deer survival etc. In other areas he discusses basic modelling concepts and provides further references as needed. He also provides even closer links between models and experimental data throughout the text. The book continues to present a broad view of the field of theoretical and mathematical biology and gives us an excellent background from which to begin genuine interdisciplinary research in the biomedical sciences.},

	abstract = {Elements of Mathematical Ecology provides an introduction to classical and modern mathematical models, methods, and issues in population ecology. The first part of the book is devoted to simple, unstructured population models that ignore much of the variability found in natural populations for the sake of tractability. Topics covered include density dependence, bifurcations, demographic stochasticity, time delays, population interactions (predation, competition, and mutualism), and the application of optimal control theory to the management of renewable resources. The second part of this book is devoted to structured population models, covering spatially-structured population models (with a focus on reaction-diffusion models), age-structured models, and two-sex models. Suitable for upper level students and beginning researchers in ecology, mathematical biology, and applied mathematics, the volume includes numerous clear line diagrams that clarify the mathematics, relevant problems throughout the text that aid understanding, and supplementary mathematical and historical material that enrich the main text.},

	abstract = {First-order difference equations arise in many contexts in the biological, economic and social sciences. Such equations, even though simple and deterministic, can exhibit a surprising array of dynamical behaviour, from stable points, to a bifurcating hierarchy of stable cycles, to apparently random fluctuations. There are consequently many fascinating problems, some concerned with delicate mathematical aspects of the fine structure of the trajectories, and some concerned with the practical implications and applications. This is an interpretive review of them.},
