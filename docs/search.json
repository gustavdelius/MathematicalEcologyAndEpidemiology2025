    "text": "Welcome\nThis site will contain the lecture notes for the Ecology and Epidemiology part of the “Mathematical Ecology, Epidemiology and Evolution” module taught at the University of York in the Spring of 2025. The mathematics used in Mathematical Ecology and in Mathematical Epidemiology are quite similar, whereas the mathematics used in Mathematical Evolution has a different flair and that part is taught by a different lecturer: George Constable.\nThe Mathematical Ecology and Epidemiology part is taught in three two-week blocks, with each block consisting of 6 lectures and one examples class. Between each block there will be a two-week block of Mathematical Evolution.\nThese days it is no longer necessary to explain why it is important to apply mathematics to ecology or to epidemiology. We are causing global warming and the only way to predict and hence mitigate the ecological consequences is to employ mathematical models. During the Covid epidemic the public was informed daily about the latest prediction about the state of the epdidemic derived from mathematical models, often summarised in terms of the \\(R_0\\) value. People with skills in mathematical modelling are clearly crucial in these fields and will have a great impact. Furthermore, the techniques of mathematical modelling are transferable to other domains. The skills you acquire in this module will also be useful if you want to model the economy or the climate, to mention just two.\nIn this module we will concentrate on mathematical models that capture the essence of the real-world phenomena and strip away most of the details. Our models will be simple enough to allow for an analytical understanding of the model predictions. In practice, more complicated models are also employed, which need to be solved numerically. Only if you are taking this module as an M-level module will you be expected to perform numerical calculations. It is very wise to first start with a simple model for which you can obtain exact results before adding complications that force you to turn to numerics. That way you can test your numerics against the exact results in the regime where they are available. Also the insight from the simple models will allow you to better interpret the output from numerical models. This deeper understanding will give you a big advantage when you continue into applied research. But this understanding is also beneficial to you as a citizen who wants to take part in discussions about ecological preservation or of vaccination or similar questions of societal importance.\nThe notes will be released after each lecture and will continue to be periodically revised. Whenever you spot something that is not quite right, please email me at gustav.delius@york.ac.uk.\nExercises are scattered throughout the notes. Exercises marked with a * are essential and are to be handed in. Exercises marked with a + are important and you are urged to complete them. Other exercises are optional but recommended. Exercises marked with an o are likely to be covered in a problems class.\nYour solutions to the essential exercises covered throughout each 2 week block are due on Monday at 9:00 in the week following that block, i.e., in weeks 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11. The exercises will then be discussed at a seminar in that week. You will then be very well prepared for the summative Moodle Quizzes that will be released at 14:00 on Thursdays in Weeks 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 and are due 24 hours later (14:00 on Fridays of Weeks 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11). These quizzes should not take you long to complete because they are based on the exercises that have already been discussed at the seminar.\nFor details of how this module will be assessed, see the assessment information on the VLE.\nIn this part of the module you are allowed (and encouraged) to get as much help from AIs (like Gemini) and CASs (Computer Algebra Systems like Wolfram Alpha) as you like. Just be aware that you won’t have access to an AI or to a CAS in the final exam, so make sure that you use the AI to learn things, not to let the AI do the work for you.",

    "section": "1.1 Exponential model",
    "text": "1.1 Exponential model\nThis is the simplest and oldest model, introduced by Thomas Robert Malthus in 1798. If we assume that the per-capita birth rate \\(b\\) and the per-capita death rate \\(d\\) are fixed constants, then the general differential equation Eq. 1.1 becomes the linear equation \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=bN-dN=rN,\n\\tag{1.2}\\] where we introduced the new parameter \\(r=b-d\\). This equation is easy to solve: \\[\nN(t)=N_0\\,e^{rt}.\n\\tag{1.3}\\] If the birth rate exceeds the death rate and hence \\(r&gt;0\\), the model predicts exponential growth. In the opposite case of lower birth rate than death rate the model predicts exponential decay of the population number towards extinction. Only when birth and death rates are perfectly equal can the population stay steady over time. We illustrate that in Figure 1.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Solutions to the exponential model.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may note that in this model \\(N(t)\\) can take on non-integer values, so strictly speaking it can not describe the number of individuals. When the population is large, this is not a big problem. You can simply round \\(N(t)\\) to the nearest integer without making much of a change. However if one wants to describe small populations correctly, one would have to switch from the deterministic differential equation to a stochastic process that models each birth and death individually. In these notes we will restrict ourselves to deterministic models.\n\n\nExercise 1.1 (* Immigration) Let us try to model the population of a country with currently \\(N_0=70\\) million inhabitants. Let us assume that the per-capita death rate is \\(d = 0.015\\) deaths per year and the per-capita birth rate is \\(b=0.01\\) births per year. In addition there is a constant rate of immigration of \\(a=300,000\\) individuals per year.\n\nWrite down the ODE for the population number \\(N(t)\\). At this point, do not use the numerical values yet but the symbols.\nSolve the ODE for \\(N(t)\\) with the given initial condition. You may not have solved an ODE for some while so may need to look back at your Calculus notes. But don’t panic: the equation from part (i) should be a linear, non-homogeneous, first-order ODE with constant coefficients, so you definitely know how to solve it. The easiest way to go about it is to first convert it into a homogeneous ODE by shifting the dependent variable.\nSubstitute the numerical values to obtain the projected population after \\(10\\) years.",

    "section": "1.2 Logistic model",
    "text": "1.2 Logistic model\nExponential population growth can not be maintained for ever. There will be a limit to the size of population that an ecosystem can maintain. When the population gets closer to this limit its growth rate will decrease, for example due to competition for limited food sources or space, or due to disease. This decrease in the growth rate is captured by the logistic equation \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right),\n\\tag{1.4}\\] where \\(K\\) is the carrying capacity of the environment. The extra factor of \\(1-N/K\\) decreases the growth rate towards zero as the population number \\(N\\) approaches the carrying capacity \\(K\\).\nIn Figure 1.2 we make a plot of the right-hand side of the logistic equation Eq. 1.4 to see how the growth rate depends on the population number. While that figure was created by the computer, the plot is easy to sketch by hand because the function we want to sketch is simply an upside-down parabola. The maximum of the parabola is at \\(N=K/2\\) and the parabola crosses the \\(N\\)-axis at \\(N=0\\) and \\(N=K\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: The logistic growth rate as a function of the population number.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the growth rate is zero at \\(N=0\\) and \\(N=K\\), and it is maximal at \\(N=K/2.\\) By realising that \\(dN/dt\\) is the slope of the graph of \\(N(t)\\) we can sketch a few solutions to the logistic equation Eq. 1.4 in Figure 1.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Solutions to the logistic equation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe logistic equation Eq. 1.4 can be solved analytically to give \\[\nN(t)=\\frac{K}{1+\\left(\\frac{K}{N_0}-1\\right)e^{-rt}}=\\frac{N_0 K e^{rt}}{K+N_0(e^{rt}-1)}.\n\\tag{1.5}\\]\n\n\nExercise 1.2 (Solving logistic equation) By using separation of variables and partial fractions, solve the logistic model Eq. 1.4 with initial condition \\(N(0)=N_0\\) to derive Eq. 1.5.\nThis exercise is for you if you like practising your skills at solving ODEs.

    "section": "1.3 Allee effect",
    "text": "1.3 Allee effect\nWarder Clyde Allee (1885-1955) was an American ecologist who studied the effects of population density on the growth rate of a population. He found that in some cases the per-capita growth rate can increase with \\(N\\). This is called the Allee effect. It is not captured by the logistic model because there the per-capita growth rate decreases linearly iwth population size.\nThere can be several causes for an Allee effect. For example:\n\nIn many plant species, pollination becomes less effective at low densities because pollinators are less likely to visit sparse populations\nSocial animals like wolves hunt more successfully in packs, so individuals in larger groups have higher survival rates\nColonial seabirds like puffins rely on large colony sizes for protection from predators\nMany marine broadcast spawners (like sea urchins or abalone) require sufficient population density for successful fertilization\nSmall populations of endangered species may suffer from genetic inbreeding, reducing reproductive success\n\nBut even in the case of an Allee effect, eventually the population growth has to slow again as the population reaches the carrying capacity of the ecosystem.\nFigure Figure 1.4 shows the per-capita growth rate as a function of the population number for exponential growth in black, for logistic growth in blue and two different growth rates exhibiting the Allee effect in green and red.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: The per-capita growth rate as a function of the population number.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe green curve in Figure 1.4 shows a weak Allee effect, where the per-capita rate is small but positive for small population sizes, then initially increases with the population size before then decreasing again as the population approaches its carrying capacity. The red curve shows a strong Allee effect, which is similar but so strong that the growth rate starts out not just small but actually negative for small \\(N\\).\nThe simplest model for the Allee effect is the logistic equation with a modified growth rate that includes another factor that decreases the growth rate for small \\(N\\): \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right)\\left(\\frac{N}{K_0}-1\\right).\n\\tag{1.6}\\] If \\(0&lt;K_0&lt;K\\), this exhibits the strong Allee effect because the growth rate is negative when \\(N&lt;K_0\\). This means that the population will be driven towards extinction when it is below the threshold size \\(K_0\\) and it will grow towards its carrying capacity when it is above \\(K_0\\). This is illustrated in Figure 1.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: The Allee growth rate as a function of the population number.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis phenomenon is important for conservation biology because it means that small populations are particularly vulnerable to extinction. It is also important for fisheries management because it means that the population can collapse if it falls below a certain threshold size. The phenomenon is called “critical depensation”. We will meet it again when we discuss harvesting later in this section.\n\n\nExercise 1.3 (*Sketching solutions) Consider the population model with carrying capacity and Allee effect given by Eq. 1.6 with \\(r&gt;0\\) and \\(K&gt;K_0&gt;0\\). Simply by considering the shape of the right hand side, sketch a graph with several solutions for different initial conditions. Choose two initial conditions between \\(0\\) and \\(K_0\\), two initial conditions between \\(K_0\\) and \\(K\\) and one initial condition larger than \\(K\\). Note that the graph only needs to be qualitatively correct, similar to the rough sketch for the solutions of the logistic model sketched in the first lecture. You are explicitly asked not to make the plot with a computer as in Figure 1.3.",

    "text": "1.4 General autonomous ODE model\nThe logistic model is a special case of a general autonomous ordinary differential equation (ODE) model \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=f(N),\n\\tag{1.7}\\] where \\(f(N)\\) is a function of \\(N\\) only, not \\(t\\). The logistic equation Eq. 1.4 is an example of such a model with\n\\[\nf(N)=rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right).\n\\tag{1.8}\\]\nIf \\(f\\) is Lipschitz continuous, then, given \\(N(0)=N_0\\), there exists a unique solution \\(N(t)\\) to the initial value problem Eq. 1.7. This is a consequence of the Picard-Lindelöf theorem.\nWe are interested in the steady states of the model, i.e. the values \\(N^*\\) for which \\(f(N^*)=0\\). These are the values of \\(N\\) for which the population number does not change. To determine the stability of the steady states, we can look near \\(N^*\\) by writing \\(N(t)=N^*+n(t)\\) with \\(n(t)\\) small. Then \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=\\frac{dN^*}{dt}+\\frac{dn}{dt} = f(N^*+n(t))\\approx f(N^*)+f'(N^*)\\,n(t).\n\\tag{1.9}\\] We now use that \\(dN^*/dt=0\\) and \\(f(N^*)=0\\) to find \\[\n\\frac{dn}{dt}\\approx f'(N^*)\\,n(t).\n\\tag{1.10}\\] This is a linear equation for \\(n(t)\\) with solution \\[\nn(t)=n(0)e^{f'(N^*)t}\n\\tag{1.11}\\] and we can use the sign of \\(f'(N^*)\\) to determine the stability of the steady state:\n\nIf \\(f'(N^*)&lt;0\\), then \\(n(t)\\) will decrease towards zero, and the steady state is stable.\nIf \\(f'(N^*)&gt;0\\), then \\(n(t)\\) will increase away from zero, and the steady state is unstable.\n\nIf \\(f'(N^*)=0\\), then we need to look at higher order terms to determine the stability.\nWe illustrate this in the example of the logistic model. The fixed points are \\(N^*=0\\) and \\(N^*=K\\). The derivative of \\(f(N)\\) is \\[\nf'(N)=r\\left(1-\\frac{2N}{K}\\right).\n\\tag{1.12}\\] So we find that \\(f'(0)=r&gt;0\\) and \\(f'(K)=-r&lt;0\\). This means that the steady state \\(N^*=0\\) is unstable and the steady state \\(N^*=K\\) is stable. This agrees with what we had already seen graphically in Figure 1.2 and Figure 1.3.\nFor a more detailed discussion of one-dimensional autonomous dynamical systems I recommend the first 50 pages of (Strogatz 2000).\n\n\nExercise 1.4 (+Von Bertalanffy growth) Assume the weight \\(w(t)\\) of an individual fish at time \\(t\\) is governed by the differential equation \\[\n\\frac{dw}{dt}=\\alpha\\,w^{2/3}-\\beta w\n\\tag{1.13}\\] with initial condition \\(w(0)=w_0\\) (the weight at birth), and where \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are positive parameters depending on the fish species.\n\nWithout solving the differential equation, just thinking about fixed points and their stability, determine \\(\\lim_{t\\rightarrow\\infty}w(t)\\).\nDerive the linear first order ODE for \\(u=w^{1/3}\\) and solve it.\nUse the solution for \\(u\\) to find the solution for \\(w\\).",

    "section": "1.5 Harvesting a renewable resource",
    "text": "1.5 Harvesting a renewable resource\nEcologists model populations not only out of academic interest but also for practical purposes. Humans are interested in exploiting the natural resources. They want to harvest fish from the sea, to hunt deer in the forest, and to cut down trees in the jungle. These days they want to do this in a way that is sustainable, i.e. that does not lead to the extinction of the resource, while at the same time giving the highest yield.\nMy personal interest is in understanding how fish populations react to different kinds of fishing. I use coupled partial integro-differential equations for that purpose, but most fisheries management is based on simpler models and we get a good first idea by using the logistic model, which we will now modify to include harvesting.\n\n1.5.1 Fixed fishing effort\nWe assume that in the absence of fishing the fish population number \\(N(t)\\) is governed by the logistic equation Eq. 1.4. We also assume that the fish are harvested at a rate \\(E N(t)\\), where \\(E\\) is the harvesting rate, which is determined by the effort that is put into fishing. This means that the rate of change in the fish population number is given by \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right)-EN = f(N).\n\\tag{1.14}\\] We can rewrite this equation in the form of a logistic equation with modified parameters: \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\\left(\\left(1-\\frac{E}{r}\\right)-\\frac{N}{K}\\right)\n=(r-E)N\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K\\left(1-\\frac{E}{r}\\right)}\\right).\n\\tag{1.15}\\] This makes it easy to read off the fixed points \\(N^*=0\\) and \\(N^*=K\\left(1-\\frac{E}{r}\\right)\\). The non-zero fixed point gets smaller when fishing effort \\(E\\) increases. This is illustrated in Figure 1.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Growth rate when harvesting with fixed effort.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are now interested in finding out at what level we should fish in order to achieve the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). This is the level of fishing effort that gives the highest possible yield that can be sustained indefinitely. So we are interested in the yield at the non-zero fixed point \\(N^*=K\\left(1-\\frac{E}{r}\\right)\\). The yield is the amount of fish that can be harvested per unit time, and it is given at the fixed point by \\[\nY^*(E)=EN^*=EK\\left(1-\\frac{E}{r}\\right).\n\\tag{1.16}\\] We can find the maximum of \\(Y^*\\) by differentiating with respect to \\(E\\) and setting the derivative equal to zero: \\[\n\\frac{dY^*}{dE}=K\\left(1-\\frac{2E}{r}\\right)=0.\n\\tag{1.17}\\] We can solve this equation for \\(E\\) to find the optimal fishing effort \\(E^*\\): \\[\nE^*=\\frac{r}{2}.\n\\tag{1.18}\\] The resulting maximum sustainable yield is \\[\nMSY=Y^*(E^*)=\\frac{r}{2}K\\left(1-\\frac{r}{2r}\\right)=\\frac{rK}{4}.\n\\tag{1.19}\\]\n\n\nExercise 1.5 (* Harvesting in Gompertz model) Consider a population \\(N(t)\\) that is described by the by the Gompertz model \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\alpha N \\log\\frac{K}{N},\n\\tag{1.20}\\] where \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(K\\) are positive constants. You want to harvest this population, for example by hunting or fishing, with some effort \\(E\\). The rate at which you harvest individuals (which removes them from the population and hence results in an additional source of death) is proportional to the size of the population: \\(Y = E N\\). This is called the yield. Write down the differential equation for \\(N(t)\\) including this harvesting term. Determine the fixed points and their stability. Find the maximum sustainable yield, i.e., the maximum yield that can be sustained indefinitely.\n\n\n\n\n1.5.2 Fixed fishing quota\nFisheries managers in the Mediterranean are aiming to control the fishing effort in order to achieve the maximum sustainable yield, and we have seen how to model that in the previous section. Fisheries in the North Sea or the North Atlantic however are instead managed by setting the total allowable catch (TAC) for the whole fleet. This is a fixed quota for the total amount of fish that can be harvested in a year. To model that policy we use the logistic equation with harvesting, but we replace the harvesting rate \\(EN\\) by a harvesting quota \\(Q\\): \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right)-Q.\n\\tag{1.21}\\] This is visualised in Figure 1.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: Growth rate when harvesting with fixed quota.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that any non-zero quota leads to critical depensation, i.e., it introduces a critical threshold below which the population will collapse. This is a well-known problem in fisheries management, and it is the reason why the TAC is set to zero for some fish stocks. As the fishing quota is increased, the critical depensation threshold moves to higher population numbers and the stable steady state moves to lower population numbers. Eventually all non-zero fixed points disappear and the population collapses.\n\n\nExercise 1.6 (Harvesting with fixed quota in Gompertz model) As in Exercise 1.5, consider a population \\(N(t)\\) that is described by the Gompertz model. Imagine that this describes a fish population in a lake where fishing is going to be introduced, and that you are tasked with setting the quota that limits the rate at which the fishers are allowed to take fish out of the lake. The fishers demand that you set the quota to the maximum sustainable level. What is the maximum sustainable quota according to the model? Would it be wise to give in to the demand of the fishers and set the quota at this level?",

    "text": "Further exercises\n\nExercise 1.7 (Wasp model) In a colony of the European Hornet there is a single queen that produces all the offspring. It produces two kinds of offspring: workers and reproducers. We’ll denote the number of workers alive at time \\(t\\) by \\(n(t)\\) and the number of reproducers by \\(N(t)\\). The workers are responsible for collecting food. They can’t breed themselves and they die in the winter. However they are necessary to allow the queen to reproduce because without the food that they are collecting the queen would have nothing to eat. So we need workers. But because they die in winter, they don’t help the survival of the colony in the long run. That’s where the reproducers come in. They don’t do any work, but they can, if they survive the winter, breed in the next spring as new queens.\nSo the queen now has a strategy of how to proceed: It first of all needs to produce workers, and from time zero to time \\(t_c\\) it only produces workers. We assume that the birth rate is proportional to the number of workers, so that the total birth rate of workers is \\(r n(t)\\) for some constant \\(r&gt;0\\). The queen then switches to producing only reproducers from time \\(t_c\\) up to the start of winter at time \\(T\\) and we assume that the total birth rate of reproducers is \\(R n(t)\\) for some constant \\(R&gt;0\\). We also assume that until the start of winter there are no deaths.\nWhat is the optimal time \\(t_c\\) at which the queen should switch from producing workers to producing reproducers in order to achieve the largest number of producers \\(N(T)\\) at the start of the winter and therefore to the largest number of wasps in the following year.\n\n\n\nExercise 1.8 (Wasp model with death) In the wasp example from Exercise 1.7, assume that the worker wasps die at a constant per-capita rate \\(d\\) but the reproducers do not die. Also assume that at time t=0 there is one worker, n(0)=1. Keep the birth rates as in Exercise 1.7. Determine the number of workers \\(n(t)\\) for any time between \\(t_c\\) and \\(T\\).

This is the discrete-time version of the continuous-time exponential model. The solution to this equation is \\[\nN_t = N_0 R^t.\n\\tag{2.3}\\] It is important to stress that \\(R\\) is not a growth rate but a dimensionless growth factor. Comparing the discrete-time solution to the continuous-time solution \\(N(t)=N_0\\exp(rt)\\) we see that they agree at integer times \\(t\\) if we measure time in years and set \\[\nR=\\exp(r \\cdot 1\\text{ year}).\n\\tag{2.4}\\] If you are confused by the units, remember that the exponential function is dimensionless, so the argument of the exponential function must be dimensionless. We need the extra factor of 1 year because \\(r\\) is a rate and has dimension 1/time.\nThe population number grows exponentially with time if \\(R&gt;1\\) and declines exponentially if \\(R&lt;1\\). To get more realistic models we again need to introduce a limited carrying capacity.\n\nExercise 2.1 (AER) You may be familiar with the distinction between the instantaneous rate \\(r\\) in a continuous-time model and the annual equivalent rate \\(R\\) in the corresponding discrete-time model from your savings account.

The most famous discrete-time logistic model is the Verhulst model:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nN_{t+1}\n&=N_t + R_0 N_t\\left(1 - \\frac{N_t}{K}\\right)\\\\\n&= (R_0+1)N_t\\left(1 - \\frac{N_t}{K(R_0+1)/R_0}\\right)\\\\\n&= RN_t\\left(1-\\frac{N_t}{\\tilde{K}}\\right)=f(N_t),\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{2.6}\\] We have written the model in two alternative forms, with \\(R=R_0+1\\) and \\(\\tilde{K}=K(R_0+1)/R_0\\), because the first form makes it easier to read off the fixed point, while the second form makes the analogy with the continuous-time logistic model more obvious. Eq. 2.6 is also often referred to as the logistic map and is a famous example of a chaotic system.\nAgain it is important to stress that \\(R_0\\) is not a growth rate but a dimensionless growth factor. We are interested in the case where \\(R_0&gt;0\\) and \\(K&gt;0\\).\nA fixed point is a value for which \\(N_{t+1}=N_t\\), i.e. a value of \\(N\\) for which the population number does not change from year to year. Thus it is a value \\(N^*\\) for which \\(f(N^*)=N^*\\). Using the second form of the model, we can see easily that the fixed points are \\(N^*=0\\) and \\(N^*=K\\), so \\(K\\) is the carrying capacity.",

    "text": "2.4 Stability and Cobwebs\nWe now want to study the stability of the fixed points in discrete-time models. As discussed, fixed points \\(N^*\\) satisfy the equation \\(N^*=f(N^*)\\). We study the stability of the fixed points by looking at the sequence \\(N_t\\) for \\(t\\) close to the fixed point. That means we write \\(N(t)=N^*+n_t\\) for \\(n_t&lt;&lt;1\\). We then have \\[\n\\begin{split}\nN_{t+1} = N^*+n_{t+1}=f(N_t) = f(N^*+n_t) = f(N^*) + f'(N^*)n_t + \\ldots\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{2.7}\\] where we have used the Taylor expansion of \\(f\\) around \\(N^*\\). Because \\(N^*\\) is a fixed point, we have \\(f(N^*)=N^*\\). Thus we find that \\[\nn_{t+1} \\approx f'(N^*)n_t\n\\tag{2.8}\\] where we neglected the higher order terms in the Taylor expansion. This is a linear equation for \\(n_t\\) that we know how to solve: \\[\nn_t = n_0 (f'(N^*))^t.\n\\tag{2.9}\\] So we have found that:\n\nIf \\(|f'(N^*)|&lt;1\\), then \\(n_t\\) will decrease with time and the fixed point is stable.\nIf \\(|f'(N^*)|&gt;1\\), then \\(n_t\\) will increase with time and the fixed point is unstable.\n\nIf \\(|f'(N^*)|=1\\), then we cannot say anything about the stability of the fixed point from this analysis.\nIn the continuous-time case we also had a graphical way to see the stability of fixed points. We will now introduce a graphical method for studying the stability of fixed points in discrete-time models, called the cobweb method.\nWe plot the function \\(f(N_t)\\) and the line \\(N_{t+1}=N_t\\). The fixed points are the intersection points of the function and the line. We then draw the graph of the sequence \\(N_t\\) by starting at the initial population number \\(N_0\\) and iterating the function \\(f(N_t)\\) to find \\(N_1\\), then iterating the function again to find \\(N_2\\), and so on. The graph of the sequence \\(N_t\\) is called the cobweb. The stability of the fixed points can be read off from the cobweb. If the cobweb spirals into the fixed point, as shown in Figure 2.1, then the fixed point is stable. If the cobweb spirals out of the fixed point, as shown in Figure 2.2, then the fixed point is unstable.

    "text": "2.5 Other models with limited carrying capacity\nYou showed in Exercise 2.3 that the Verhulst model has the disadvantage that it can give negative population numbers. There are several other models that are discrete-time versions of the logistic model and do not have this problem. We will now look at the two most important of them.\n\n2.5.1 Ricker model\nMany fish species, like salmon, have distinct breeding seasons and their reproduction shows strong density dependence - when population density is too high, fewer offspring survive due to competition for spawning sites. The Ricker model captures this behavior through the equation:\n\\[\nN_{t+1} = N_t\\, e^{R_0\\left(1 - \\frac{N_t}{K}\\right)}.\n\\tag{2.11}\\]\nBy moving the logistic factor inside the exponential, the Ricker model prevents negative population numbers. The fixed points are still \\(N^*=0\\) and \\(N^*=K\\). Ricker introduced this model to describe salmon populations.\n\n\nExercise 2.4 (* Ricker model) Find the fixed points in the Ricker model \\[\nN_{t+1} = N_t\\, e^{R_0\\left(1 - \\frac{N_t}{K}\\right)}.\n\\tag{2.12}\\] and investigate their stability. Do this both analytically and by drawing cobweb diagrams.\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Beverton-Holt model\nThe Beverton-Holt model, introduced by Ray Beverton and Sidney Holt in 1957, was developed to understand fish population dynamics. The model arose from their groundbreaking work on sustainable fisheries management while working at the Fisheries Laboratory in Lowestoft, UK. They were particularly interested in how the number of young fish (recruits) entering a population depends on the number of parent fish (spawning stock).\nThey proposed the model\n\\[\nN_{t+1} = \\frac{R N_t}{1 + \\frac{R-1}{K}N_t}.\n\\tag{2.13}\\]\nThis has been a very influential model in fisheries science. On the face of it the model does not look very similar to the logistic model, but we will see the relationship when we solve the model. The trick is to make a change of variables from \\(N_t\\) to \\(u_t = 1/N_t\\). Then we have \\[\nu_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{N_{t+1}} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{R-1}{K}N_t}{R N_t} = \\frac{u_t}{R} + \\frac{R-1}{R K}.\n\\tag{2.14}\\] This is a linear equation for \\(u_t\\), and linear equations are easy to solve. The easiest way to proceed is to look at the first few terms of the sequence \\(u_t\\) and guess the general form of the solution. We find \\[\\begin{split}\nu_1 &= \\frac{u_0}{R} + \\frac{R-1}{R K},\\\\\nu_2 &= \\frac{u_0}{R^2} + \\frac{R-1}{R K}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{R}\\right),\\\\\nu_3 &= \\frac{u_0}{R^3} + \\frac{R-1}{R K}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{R} + \\frac{1}{R^2}\\right),\\\\\n&\\vdots\\\\\nu_t &= \\frac{u_0}{R^t} + \\frac{R-1}{R K}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{R} + \\frac{1}{R^2} + \\ldots + \\frac{1}{R^{t-1}}\\right).\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{2.15}\\] The sum in the second term is a geometric series. We know the general formula for a geometric series: \\[\n1 + x + x^2 + \\ldots + x^{t-1} = \\frac{1 - x^t}{1 - x}.\n\\tag{2.16}\\]\nWe can use this with \\(x=1/R\\) to sum terms in the second term. We find \\[\nu_t = \\frac{u_0}{R^t} + \\frac{R-1}{R K}\\frac{1 - (1/R)^t}{1 - 1/R}.\n\\] We simplify this a bit and bring everything on the same denominator. \\[\nu_t = \\frac{u_0}{R^t} - \\frac{(1/R)^t-1}{K}\n=\\frac{Ku_0-1+R^t}{KR^t}.\n\\tag{2.17}\\]\nWe can now change back to \\(N_t=1/u_t\\) to find the solution to the Beverton-Holt model. We find \\[\n\\begin{split}\nN_t &= \\frac{1}{u_t}=\\frac{K R^t}{Ku_0-1+R^t}\\\\\n&=\\frac{K/u_0}{KR^{-t}-R^{-t}/u_0+1/u_0}\\\\\n&=\\frac{KN_0}{N_0+(K-N_0)R^{-t}}.\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{2.18}\\]\nThis is the solution to the Beverton-Holt model. Comparing this to the solution of the continuous-time logistic model \\[\nN(t) = \\frac{KN_0}{N_0+(K-N_0)\\exp(-rt)}\n\\tag{2.19}\\] we see that they agree at integer times \\(t\\) if we measure time in years and set \\(R=\\exp(r \\cdot 1\\text{ year}).\\)\n\n\nBeverton-Holt model\n\nExercise 2.5 Find the fixed points in the Beverton-Holt model \\[\nN_{t+1} = \\frac{R N_t}{1 + \\frac{R-1}{K}N_t}.\n\\tag{2.20}\\] and investigate their stability.

    "section": "2.6 Discrete-time harvesting model",
    "text": "2.6 Discrete-time harvesting model\nWe will now look at an example of a discrete-time model with harvesting and apply the techniques we have learned. The model has the standard discrete-time model form \\(N_{t+1}=f(N_t)\\), where \\(f\\) in our example is \\[\nf(N) = \\frac{b N^2}{1+N^2}-EN.\n\\] The constant \\(b&gt;2\\) determines the growth rate of the population and the harvesting rate is determined by the harvesting effort \\(E\\).\nWe start by studying the model without harvesting, so we set \\(E=0\\) for now. As usual, we start by looking at the steady states of the model. The fixed points are the solutions to the equation \\[\nN^* = \\frac{b\\,{N^*}^2}{1+{N^*}^2}.\n\\] There is the obvious solution \\(N^*=0\\). We can then find the non-zero solutions by dividing both sides by \\(N^*\\) and multiply them by \\(1+{N^*}^2\\) to get the equation \\[\n1+{N^*}^2 = bN^*.\n\\] This is a quadratic equation for \\(N^*\\), which we could rewrite in the more conventional form \\[\n{N^*}^2 - bN^* + 1 = 0.\n\\] The solutions to this equation are \\[\nN^*_\\pm = \\frac{b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4}}{2}.\n\\] The solutions are real if \\(b^2-4\\geq 0\\), i.e. if \\(b\\geq 2\\), which we have stipulated earlier. Both solutions are positive.\nWe now have enough information to draw a good sketch to understand the dynamics of the model. We can draw the function \\(f(N)\\) and the line \\(N_{t+1}=N_t\\). It may not be immediately obvious what the sketch of \\(f(N)=bN^2/(1+N^2)\\) looks like. We’ll reason ourselves through this in steps:\n\nFirst let us consider what happens near \\(N=0\\). There the function is approximately \\(f(N)\\approx bN^2\\). This is a parabola that opens upwards. The function is zero at \\(N=0\\) and increases quadratically with \\(N\\).\nNext we consider what happens as \\(N\\) becomes large. There the function is approximately \\(f(N)\\approx b\\). So the graph has a horizontal asymptote at \\(y=b\\).\nWe know that in between there are two fixed points. That means the graph needs to cross the diagonal line \\(y=N\\) twice.\nFinally we observe that the function is monotonically increasing.\n\nIf we now draw something that has all these features, we will have a sufficiently good sketch of the function for our purpose of understanding the dynamics of the model. We will necessarily end up with something that qualitatively looks like the graph in Figure 2.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Graph of the function \\(f(N)=\\frac{bN^2}{1+N^2}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing our cobweb technique, or simply looking at the slope of \\(f\\) at the fixed points, we can easily convince ourselves that the extinction fixed point is stable, the smaller non-zero fixed point \\(N^*_-\\) is unstable and the larger fixed point \\(N^*_+\\) is stable. in Figure 2.4 we have indicated the stable fixed points by solid circles and the unstable fixed points by open circles. So when the population number is larger than \\(N^*_-\\) it will grow towards \\(N^*_+\\), and when it is smaller than \\(N^*_-\\) it will go extinct. So this model exhibits a strong Allee effect with critical depensation. \\(N^*_-\\) is the smallest viable population size.\nWe can now add harvesting to the model. The extra term in the function \\(f(N)\\) is \\(-EN\\). This lowers the graph of \\(f(N)\\) by an amount that grows linearly with \\(N\\). This is illustrated in Figure 2.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Graph of the function \\(f(N)=\\frac{bN^2}{1+N^2}-EN\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that as the harvesting effort \\(E\\) increases, the two fixed points move closer together. At a critical value \\(E_c\\) the two fixed points merge and disappear. The population number will then go extinct for all initial population numbers.\nLet us find the critical value \\(E_c\\). For that we first determine the location of the fixed points in the presence of harvesting. So we solve the equation \\[\nN^* = \\frac{b\\,{N^*}^2}{1+{N^*}^2}-EN^*.\n\\] Again this has a solution \\(N^*=0\\). We can then find the non-zero solutions by dividing both sides by \\(N^*\\) and multiply them by \\(1+{N^*}^2\\) to get the equation \\[\n(1+E){N^*}^2-bN^*+1+E = 0.\n\\] This is solved by \\[\nN^*_\\pm = \\frac{\\frac{b}{1+E}\\pm\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{b}{1+E}\\right)^2-4}}{2}.\n\\] We see that these solutions are real only if \\(\\left(\\frac{b}{1+E}\\right)^2-4\\geq 0\\), i.e., if \\(E&lt; \\frac{b-2}{2}\\). Thus the critical effort is \\(E_c=\\frac{b-2}{2}\\). Fishing above this level will lead to extinction of the population. But even fishing just near this level is risky because the population number will be very close to the minimum viable population and a small disturbance could lead to extinction.",

You have seen there that in one-dimensional systems described by a single ODE there are three different types of bifurcation: saddle-node, pitchfork, transcritical. The same types of bifurcations can occur in discrete-time models but there is also one more type: the period-doubling bifurcation.\nLet’s examine each type:\n\nSaddle-node bifurcation (also called tangent bifurcation): Two fixed points - one stable and one unstable - approach each other as a parameter varies, collide, and then disappear. At the critical parameter value, the function \\(f(N)\\) is tangent to the line \\(y=N\\) at the collision point. We saw this in the harvesting model where increasing the harvesting effort \\(E\\) caused two fixed points to merge and vanish.\n\nExample using \\(f(N) = 2 + r - (N-2)^2\\):\n\nCode\n# First plot (f(N) curves)\ndef f(N, r):\n    return 2 + r - (N-2)**2\n\nN = np.linspace(0, 4, 200)\nr_values = [1.0, 0.0, -1.0]\nlabels = ['Before (r=1.0)', 'At (r=0.0)', 'After (r=-1.0)']\ncolors = ['blue', 'green', 'red']\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))\nfor r, label, color in zip(r_values, labels, colors):\n    plt.plot(N, f(N, r), label=label, color=color)\nplt.plot(N, N, 'k--', label='y=N')\nplt.xlabel('N')\nplt.ylabel('f(N)')\nplt.legend()\nplt.title('f(N) at different r values')\nplt.show()\n\n# Second plot (bifurcation diagram)\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))\nr = np.linspace(-1.5, 1.5, 1000)\n# Calculate fixed points\nN_plus = 2 + np.sqrt(np.maximum(r, 0))  # stable branch\nN_minus = 2 - np.sqrt(np.maximum(r, 0))  # unstable branch\nplt.plot(r[r&gt;=0], N_plus[r&gt;=0], 'b-', label='Stable')\nplt.plot(r[r&gt;=0], N_minus[r&gt;=0], 'b--', label='Unstable')\nplt.xlabel('r')\nplt.ylabel('Fixed points')\nplt.legend()\nplt.title('Bifurcation diagram')\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Saddle-node bifurcation: Left shows f(N) at different r values, right shows bifurcation diagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6\n\n\n\n\nTranscritical bifurcation: Two fixed points exchange their stability properties as they pass through each other. The fixed points don’t disappear - they simply swap their stable/unstable nature. This often occurs when a non-zero fixed point passes through zero, exchanging stability with the extinction fixed point.\n\nExample using \\(f(N) = 2 + (r-1)(N-2) + \\frac{1}{2}(N-2)^2\\):\n\nCode\n# First plot (unchanged)\ndef f(N, r):\n    return 2 + (r-1)*(N-2) + 0.5*(N-2)**2\n\nN = np.linspace(0, 4, 200)\nr_values = [0.5, 1.0, 1.5]\nlabels = ['Before (r=0.5)', 'At (r=1.0)', 'After (r=1.5)']\ncolors = ['blue', 'green', 'red']\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))\nfor r, label, color in zip(r_values, labels, colors):\n    plt.plot(N, f(N, r), label=label, color=color)\nplt.plot(N, N, 'k--', label='y=N')\nplt.xlabel('N')\nplt.ylabel('f(N)')\nplt.legend()\nplt.title('f(N) at different r values')\nplt.show()\n\n# Second plot (bifurcation diagram)\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))\nr = np.linspace(0, 2, 1000)\n# Fixed points\nN1 = np.full_like(r, 2)  # horizontal line at N=2\nplt.plot(r[r&lt;1], N1[r&lt;1], 'b-', label='Stable')\nplt.plot(r[r&gt;1], N1[r&gt;1], 'b--', label='Unstable')\nN2 = 2 + 2*(r-1)  # sloped line\nplt.plot(r[r&lt;1], N2[r&lt;1], 'b--')\nplt.plot(r[r&gt;1], N2[r&gt;1], 'b-')\nplt.xlabel('r')\nplt.ylabel('Fixed points')\nplt.legend()\nplt.title('Bifurcation diagram')\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Transcritical bifurcation: Left shows f(N) at different r values, right shows bifurcation diagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7\n\n\n\n\nPitchfork bifurcation: A single fixed point splits into three fixed points (or vice versa) as a parameter varies.

We study the stability of the fixed points by looking at the sequence \\(N_t\\) for \\(t\\) close to the fixed point. That means we write \\(N(t)=N^*+n_t\\) for \\(n_t&lt;&lt;1\\). We then have \\[\n\\begin{split}\nN_{t+1} = N^*+n_{t+1}=f(N_t) = f(N^*+n_t) = f(N^*) + f'(N^*)n_t + \\ldots\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{2.7}\\] where we have used the Taylor expansion of \\(f\\) around \\(N^*\\). Because \\(N^*\\) is a fixed point, we have \\(f(N^*)=N^*\\). Thus we find that \\[\nn_{t+1} \\approx f'(N^*)n_t\n\\tag{2.8}\\] where we neglected the higher order terms in the Taylor expansion.

    "text": "2.4 Cobweb diagrams\nIn the continuous-time case we also had a graphical way to see the stability of fixed points. We will now introduce a graphical method for studying the stability of fixed points in discrete-time models, called the cobweb method.\nWe plot the function \\(f(N_t)\\) and the line \\(N_{t+1}=N_t\\). The fixed points are the intersection points of the function and the line. We then draw the graph of the sequence \\(N_t\\) by starting at the initial population number \\(N_0\\) and iterating the function \\(f(N_t)\\) to find \\(N_1\\), then iterating the function again to find \\(N_2\\), and so on. The graph of the sequence \\(N_t\\) is called the cobweb. The stability of the fixed points can be read off from the cobweb. If the cobweb spirals into the fixed point, as shown in Figure 2.1, then the fixed point is stable. If the cobweb spirals out of the fixed point, as shown in Figure 2.2, then the fixed point is unstable.
