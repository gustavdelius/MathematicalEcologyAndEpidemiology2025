    "text": "Welcome\nThis site will contain the lecture notes for the Ecology and Epidemiology part of the “Mathematical Ecology, Epidemiology and Evolution” module taught at the University of York in the Spring of 2025. The mathematics used in Mathematical Ecology and in Mathematical Epidemiology are quite similar, whereas the mathematics used in Mathematical Evolution has a different flair and that part is taught by a different lecturer: George Constable.\nThe Mathematical Ecology and Epidemiology part is taught in three two-week blocks, with each block consisting of 6 lectures and one examples class. Between each block there will be a two-week block of Mathematical Evolution.\nThese days it is no longer necessary to explain why it is important to apply mathematics to ecology or to epidemiology. We are causing global warming and the only way to predict and hence mitigate the ecological consequences is to employ mathematical models. During the Covid epidemic the public was informed daily about the latest prediction about the state of the epdidemic derived from mathematical models, often summarised in terms of the \\(R_0\\) value. People with skills in mathematical modelling are clearly crucial in these fields and will have a great impact. Furthermore, the techniques of mathematical modelling are transferable to other domains. The skills you acquire in this module will also be useful if you want to model the economy or the climate, to mention just two.\nIn this module we will concentrate on mathematical models that capture the essence of the real-world phenomena and strip away most of the details. Our models will be simple enough to allow for an analytical understanding of the model predictions. In practice, more complicated models are also employed, which need to be solved numerically. Only if you are taking this module as an M-level module will you be expected to perform numerical calculations. It is very wise to first start with a simple model for which you can obtain exact results before adding complications that force you to turn to numerics. That way you can test your numerics against the exact results in the regime where they are available. Also the insight from the simple models will allow you to better interpret the output from numerical models. This deeper understanding will give you a big advantage when you continue into applied research. But this understanding is also beneficial to you as a citizen who wants to take part in discussions about ecological preservation or of vaccination or similar questions of societal importance.\nThe notes will be released after each lecture and will continue to be periodically revised. Whenever you spot something that is not quite right, please email me at gustav.delius@york.ac.uk.\nExercises are scattered throughout the notes. Exercises marked with a * are essential and are to be handed in. Exercises marked with a + are important and you are urged to complete them. Other exercises are optional but recommended. Exercises marked with an o are likely to be covered in a problems class.\nYour solutions to the essential exercises covered throughout each 2 week block are due on Monday at 9:00 in the week following that block, i.e., in weeks 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11. The exercises will then be discussed at a seminar in that week. You will then be very well prepared for the summative Moodle Quizzes that will be released at 14:00 on Thursdays in Weeks 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 and are due 24 hours later (14:00 on Fridays of Weeks 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11). These quizzes should not take you long to complete because they are based on the exercises that have already been discussed at the seminar.\nFor details of how this module will be assessed, see the assessment information on the VLE.\nIn this part of the module you are allowed (and encouraged) to get as much help from AIs (like Gemini) and CASs (Computer Algebra Systems like Wolfram Alpha) as you like. Just be aware that you won’t have access to an AI or to a CAS in the final exam, so make sure that you use the AI to learn things, not to let the AI do the work for you.",

    "text": "Learning Objectives\nPopulation dynamics is the study of how populations change over time. A population can be any group of individuals of the same species in a particular area, such as a population of bacteria in a petri dish, a herd of deer in a forest, the Cod stock in the Baltic Sea, or the human population of a country. Understanding how population size evolves is important in many fields, including ecology, conservation biology, epidemiology, and resource management.\nTo model a population mathematically, we introduce a function \\(N(t)\\) that represents the number of individuals in the population at time \\(t\\). We assume that at the starting time, which we take to be \\(t=0\\), the population has some initial size \\(N(0)=N_0\\).\nSince the population size changes over time, we are interested in its rate of change, which describes how quickly individuals are added or removed from the population. There are several fundamental processes that affect population size:\nThese processes together determine the overall rate of change of the population, which we can express mathematically as: \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\text{birth rate} - \\text{death rate} + \\text{immigration rate} - \\text{emigration rate}.\n\\tag{1.1}\\] The idea behind this approach is that if we understand how the rates at which these processes take place depend on the population number \\(N\\), then we can find \\(N(t)\\) by solving the above differential equation. Different assumptions about how these rates depend on the population size (or possibly other factors such as available resources or competition) lead to different population models. In the following sections, we will examine some influential models that help us understand different population growth scenarios.\nAfter completing this chapter, you should be able to:",

    "section": "1.1 Exponential model",
    "text": "1.1 Exponential model\nThis is the simplest and oldest model, introduced by Thomas Robert Malthus in 1798. If we assume that the per-capita birth rate \\(b\\) and the per-capita death rate \\(d\\) are fixed constants, then the general differential equation Eq. 1.1 becomes the linear equation \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=bN-dN=rN,\n\\tag{1.2}\\] where we introduced the new parameter \\(r=b-d\\). This equation is easy to solve: \\[\nN(t)=N_0\\,e^{rt}.\n\\tag{1.3}\\] If the birth rate exceeds the death rate and hence \\(r&gt;0\\), the model predicts exponential growth. In the opposite case of lower birth rate than death rate the model predicts exponential decay of the population number towards extinction. Only when birth and death rates are perfectly equal can the population stay steady over time. We illustrate that in Figure 1.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Solutions to the exponential model.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may note that in this model \\(N(t)\\) can take on non-integer values, so strictly speaking it can not describe the number of individuals. When the population is large, this is not a big problem. You can simply round \\(N(t)\\) to the nearest integer without making much of a change. However if one wants to describe small populations correctly, one would have to switch from the deterministic differential equation to a stochastic process that models each birth and death individually. In these notes we will restrict ourselves to deterministic models.\n\n\nExercise 1.1 (* Immigration) Let us try to model the population of a country with currently \\(N_0=70\\) million inhabitants. Let us assume that the per-capita death rate is \\(d = 0.015\\) deaths per year and the per-capita birth rate is \\(b=0.01\\) births per year. In addition there is a constant rate of immigration of \\(a=300,000\\) individuals per year.\n\nWrite down the ODE for the population number \\(N(t)\\). At this point, do not use the numerical values yet but the symbols.\nSolve the ODE for \\(N(t)\\) with the given initial condition. You may not have solved an ODE for some while so may need to look back at your Calculus notes. But don’t panic: the equation from part (i) should be a linear, non-homogeneous, first-order ODE with constant coefficients, so you definitely know how to solve it. The easiest way to go about it is to first convert it into a homogeneous ODE by shifting the dependent variable.\nSubstitute the numerical values to obtain the projected population after \\(10\\) years.",

    "text": "1.2 Logistic model\nExponential population growth can not be maintained for ever. There will be a limit to the size of population that an ecosystem can maintain. When the population gets closer to this limit its growth rate will decrease, for example due to competition for limited food sources or space, or due to disease. This decrease in the growth rate is captured by the logistic equation \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right),\n\\tag{1.4}\\] where \\(K\\) is the carrying capacity of the environment. The extra factor of \\(1-N/K\\) decreases the growth rate towards zero as the population number \\(N\\) approaches the carrying capacity \\(K\\).\nIn Figure 1.2 we make a plot of the right-hand side of the logistic equation Eq. 1.4 to see how the growth rate depends on the population number. While that figure was created by the computer, the plot is easy to sketch by hand because the function we want to sketch is simply an upside-down parabola. The maximum of the parabola is at \\(N=K/2\\) and the parabola crosses the \\(N\\)-axis at \\(N=0\\) and \\(N=K\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: The logistic growth rate as a function of the population number.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the growth rate is zero at \\(N=0\\) and \\(N=K\\), and it is maximal at \\(N=K/2.\\) By realising that \\(dN/dt\\) is the slope of the graph of \\(N(t)\\) we can sketch a few solutions to the logistic equation Eq. 1.4 in Figure 1.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Solutions to the logistic equation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe logistic equation Eq. 1.4 can be solved analytically to give \\[\nN(t)=\\frac{K}{1+\\left(\\frac{K}{N_0}-1\\right)e^{-rt}}=\\frac{N_0 K e^{rt}}{K+N_0(e^{rt}-1)}.\n\\tag{1.5}\\]\n\n\nExercise 1.2 (Solving logistic equation) By using separation of variables and partial fractions, solve the logistic model Eq. 1.4 with initial condition \\(N(0)=N_0\\) to derive Eq. 1.5.\nThis exercise is for you if you like practising your skills at solving ODEs.

    "section": "1.3 Allee effect",
    "text": "1.3 Allee effect\nWarder Clyde Allee (1885-1955) was an American ecologist who studied the effects of population density on the growth rate of a population. He found that in some cases the per-capita growth rate can increase with \\(N\\). This is called the Allee effect. It is not captured by the logistic model because there the per-capita growth rate decreases linearly iwth population size.\nThere can be several causes for an Allee effect. For example:\n\nIn many plant species, pollination becomes less effective at low densities because pollinators are less likely to visit sparse populations\nSocial animals like wolves hunt more successfully in packs, so individuals in larger groups have higher survival rates\nColonial seabirds like puffins rely on large colony sizes for protection from predators\nMany marine broadcast spawners (like sea urchins or abalone) require sufficient population density for successful fertilization\nSmall populations of endangered species may suffer from genetic inbreeding, reducing reproductive success\n\nBut even in the case of an Allee effect, eventually the population growth has to slow again as the population reaches the carrying capacity of the ecosystem.\nFigure Figure 1.4 shows the per-capita growth rate as a function of the population number for exponential growth in black, for logistic growth in blue and two different growth rates exhibiting the Allee effect in green and red.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: The per-capita growth rate as a function of the population number.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe green curve in Figure 1.4 shows a weak Allee effect, where the per-capita rate is small but positive for small population sizes, then initially increases with the population size before then decreasing again as the population approaches its carrying capacity. The red curve shows a strong Allee effect, which is similar but so strong that the growth rate starts out not just small but actually negative for small \\(N\\).\nThe simplest model for the Allee effect is the logistic equation with a modified growth rate that includes another factor that decreases the growth rate for small \\(N\\): \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right)\\left(\\frac{N}{K_0}-1\\right).\n\\tag{1.6}\\] If \\(0&lt;K_0&lt;K\\), this exhibits the strong Allee effect because the growth rate is negative when \\(N&lt;K_0\\). This means that the population will be driven towards extinction when it is below the threshold size \\(K_0\\) and it will grow towards its carrying capacity when it is above \\(K_0\\). This is illustrated in Figure 1.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: The Allee growth rate as a function of the population number.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis phenomenon is important for conservation biology because it means that small populations are particularly vulnerable to extinction. It is also important for fisheries management because it means that the population can collapse if it falls below a certain threshold size. The phenomenon is called “critical depensation”. We will meet it again when we discuss harvesting later in this section.\n\n\nExercise 1.3 (*Sketching solutions) Consider the population model with carrying capacity and Allee effect given by Eq. 1.6 with \\(r&gt;0\\) and \\(K&gt;K_0&gt;0\\). Simply by considering the shape of the right hand side, sketch a graph with several solutions for different initial conditions. Choose two initial conditions between \\(0\\) and \\(K_0\\), two initial conditions between \\(K_0\\) and \\(K\\) and one initial condition larger than \\(K\\). Note that the graph only needs to be qualitatively correct, similar to the rough sketch for the solutions of the logistic model sketched in the first lecture. You are explicitly asked not to make the plot with a computer as in Figure 1.3.",

    "text": "1.4 General autonomous ODE model\nThe logistic model is a special case of a general autonomous ordinary differential equation (ODE) model \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=f(N),\n\\tag{1.7}\\] where \\(f(N)\\) is a function of \\(N\\) only, not \\(t\\). The logistic equation Eq. 1.4 is an example of such a model with\n\\[\nf(N)=rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right).\n\\tag{1.8}\\]\nIf \\(f\\) is Lipschitz continuous, then, given \\(N(0)=N_0\\), there exists a unique solution \\(N(t)\\) to the initial value problem Eq. 1.7. This is a consequence of the Picard-Lindelöf theorem.\nWe are interested in the steady states of the model, i.e. the values \\(N^*\\) for which \\(f(N^*)=0\\). These are the values of \\(N\\) for which the population number does not change. To determine the stability of the steady states, we can look near \\(N^*\\) by writing \\(N(t)=N^*+n(t)\\) with \\(n(t)\\) small. Then \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=\\frac{dN^*}{dt}+\\frac{dn}{dt} = f(N^*+n(t))\\approx f(N^*)+f'(N^*)\\,n(t).\n\\tag{1.9}\\] We now use that \\(dN^*/dt=0\\) and \\(f(N^*)=0\\) to find \\[\n\\frac{dn}{dt}\\approx f'(N^*)\\,n(t).\n\\tag{1.10}\\] This is a linear equation for \\(n(t)\\) with solution \\[\nn(t)=n(0)e^{f'(N^*)t}\n\\tag{1.11}\\] and we can use the sign of \\(f'(N^*)\\) to determine the stability of the steady state:\n\nIf \\(f'(N^*)&lt;0\\), then \\(n(t)\\) will decrease towards zero, and the steady state is stable.\nIf \\(f'(N^*)&gt;0\\), then \\(n(t)\\) will increase away from zero, and the steady state is unstable.\n\nIf \\(f'(N^*)=0\\), then we need to look at higher order terms to determine the stability.\nWe illustrate this in the example of the logistic model. The fixed points are \\(N^*=0\\) and \\(N^*=K\\). The derivative of \\(f(N)\\) is \\[\nf'(N)=r\\left(1-\\frac{2N}{K}\\right).\n\\tag{1.12}\\] So we find that \\(f'(0)=r&gt;0\\) and \\(f'(K)=-r&lt;0\\). This means that the steady state \\(N^*=0\\) is unstable and the steady state \\(N^*=K\\) is stable. This agrees with what we had already seen graphically in Figure 1.2 and Figure 1.3.\nFor a more detailed discussion of one-dimensional autonomous dynamical systems I recommend the first 50 pages of (Strogatz 2000).\n\n\nExercise 1.4 (+Von Bertalanffy growth) Assume the weight \\(w(t)\\) of an individual fish at time \\(t\\) is governed by the differential equation \\[\n\\frac{dw}{dt}=\\alpha\\,w^{2/3}-\\beta w\n\\tag{1.13}\\] with initial condition \\(w(0)=w_0\\) (the weight at birth), and where \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are positive parameters depending on the fish species.\n\nWithout solving the differential equation, just thinking about fixed points and their stability, determine \\(\\lim_{t\\rightarrow\\infty}w(t)\\).\nDerive the linear first order ODE for \\(u=w^{1/3}\\) and solve it.\nUse the solution for \\(u\\) to find the solution for \\(w\\).",

    "section": "1.5 Harvesting a renewable resource",
    "text": "1.5 Harvesting a renewable resource\nEcologists model populations not only out of academic interest but also for practical purposes. Humans are interested in exploiting the natural resources. They want to harvest fish from the sea, to hunt deer in the forest, and to cut down trees in the jungle. These days they want to do this in a way that is sustainable, i.e. that does not lead to the extinction of the resource, while at the same time giving the highest yield.\nMy personal interest is in understanding how fish populations react to different kinds of fishing. I use coupled partial integro-differential equations for that purpose, but most fisheries management is based on simpler models and we get a good first idea by using the logistic model, which we will now modify to include harvesting.\n\n1.5.1 Fixed fishing effort\nWe assume that in the absence of fishing the fish population number \\(N(t)\\) is governed by the logistic equation Eq. 1.4. We also assume that the fish are harvested at a rate \\(E N(t)\\), where \\(E\\) is the harvesting rate, which is determined by the effort that is put into fishing. This means that the rate of change in the fish population number is given by \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right)-EN = f(N).\n\\tag{1.14}\\] We can rewrite this equation in the form of a logistic equation with modified parameters: \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\\left(\\left(1-\\frac{E}{r}\\right)-\\frac{N}{K}\\right)\n=(r-E)N\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K\\left(1-\\frac{E}{r}\\right)}\\right).\n\\tag{1.15}\\] This makes it easy to read off the fixed points \\(N^*=0\\) and \\(N^*=K\\left(1-\\frac{E}{r}\\right)\\). The non-zero fixed point gets smaller when fishing effort \\(E\\) increases. This is illustrated in Figure 1.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Growth rate when harvesting with fixed effort.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are now interested in finding out at what level we should fish in order to achieve the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). This is the level of fishing effort that gives the highest possible yield that can be sustained indefinitely. So we are interested in the yield at the non-zero fixed point \\(N^*=K\\left(1-\\frac{E}{r}\\right)\\). The yield is the amount of fish that can be harvested per unit time, and it is given at the fixed point by \\[\nY^*(E)=EN^*=EK\\left(1-\\frac{E}{r}\\right).\n\\tag{1.16}\\] We can find the maximum of \\(Y^*\\) by differentiating with respect to \\(E\\) and setting the derivative equal to zero: \\[\n\\frac{dY^*}{dE}=K\\left(1-\\frac{2E}{r}\\right)=0.\n\\tag{1.17}\\] We can solve this equation for \\(E\\) to find the optimal fishing effort \\(E^*\\): \\[\nE^*=\\frac{r}{2}.\n\\tag{1.18}\\] The resulting maximum sustainable yield is \\[\nMSY=Y^*(E^*)=\\frac{r}{2}K\\left(1-\\frac{r}{2r}\\right)=\\frac{rK}{4}.\n\\tag{1.19}\\]\n\n\nExercise 1.5 (* Harvesting in Gompertz model) Consider a population \\(N(t)\\) that is described by the by the Gompertz model \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\alpha N \\log\\frac{K}{N},\n\\tag{1.20}\\] where \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(K\\) are positive constants. You want to harvest this population, for example by hunting or fishing, with some effort \\(E\\). The rate at which you harvest individuals (which removes them from the population and hence results in an additional source of death) is proportional to the size of the population: \\(Y = E N\\). This is called the yield. Write down the differential equation for \\(N(t)\\) including this harvesting term. Determine the fixed points and their stability. Find the maximum sustainable yield, i.e., the maximum yield that can be sustained indefinitely.\n\n\n\n\n1.5.2 Fixed fishing quota\nFisheries managers in the Mediterranean are aiming to control the fishing effort in order to achieve the maximum sustainable yield, and we have seen how to model that in the previous section. Fisheries in the North Sea or the North Atlantic however are instead managed by setting the total allowable catch (TAC) for the whole fleet. This is a fixed quota for the total amount of fish that can be harvested in a year. To model that policy we use the logistic equation with harvesting, but we replace the harvesting rate \\(EN\\) by a harvesting quota \\(Q\\): \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right)-Q.\n\\tag{1.21}\\] This is visualised in Figure 1.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: Growth rate when harvesting with fixed quota.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that any non-zero quota leads to critical depensation, i.e., it introduces a critical threshold below which the population will collapse. This is a well-known problem in fisheries management, and it is the reason why the TAC is set to zero for some fish stocks. As the fishing quota is increased, the critical depensation threshold moves to higher population numbers and the stable steady state moves to lower population numbers. Eventually all non-zero fixed points disappear and the population collapses.\n\n\nExercise 1.6 (Harvesting with fixed quota in Gompertz model) As in Exercise 1.5, consider a population \\(N(t)\\) that is described by the Gompertz model. Imagine that this describes a fish population in a lake where fishing is going to be introduced, and that you are tasked with setting the quota that limits the rate at which the fishers are allowed to take fish out of the lake. The fishers demand that you set the quota to the maximum sustainable level. What is the maximum sustainable quota according to the model? Would it be wise to give in to the demand of the fishers and set the quota at this level?",

    "text": "Further exercises\n\nExercise 1.7 (Wasp model) In a colony of the European Hornet there is a single queen that produces all the offspring. It produces two kinds of offspring: workers and reproducers. We’ll denote the number of workers alive at time \\(t\\) by \\(n(t)\\) and the number of reproducers by \\(N(t)\\). The workers are responsible for collecting food. They can’t breed themselves and they die in the winter. However they are necessary to allow the queen to reproduce because without the food that they are collecting the queen would have nothing to eat. So we need workers. But because they die in winter, they don’t help the survival of the colony in the long run. That’s where the reproducers come in. They don’t do any work, but they can, if they survive the winter, breed in the next spring as new queens.\nSo the queen now has a strategy of how to proceed: It first of all needs to produce workers, and from time zero to time \\(t_c\\) it only produces workers. We assume that the birth rate is proportional to the number of workers, so that the total birth rate of workers is \\(r n(t)\\) for some constant \\(r&gt;0\\). The queen then switches to producing only reproducers from time \\(t_c\\) up to the start of winter at time \\(T\\) and we assume that the total birth rate of reproducers is \\(R n(t)\\) for some constant \\(R&gt;0\\). We also assume that until the start of winter there are no deaths.\nWhat is the optimal time \\(t_c\\) at which the queen should switch from producing workers to producing reproducers in order to achieve the largest number of producers \\(N(T)\\) at the start of the winter and therefore to the largest number of wasps in the following year.\n\n\n\nExercise 1.8 (Wasp model with death) In the wasp example from Exercise 1.7, assume that the worker wasps die at a constant per-capita rate \\(d\\) but the reproducers do not die.

    "text": "Learning Objectives\nSo far we have assumed that the rate of change of the population number has no explicit time dependence. However births and also deaths often happen on an annual cycle. Many fish have their spawning season in the spring, and many birds breed in the summer and annual plants produce their seed and then die in winter. In this case, the rate of change of the population number is not constant, but depends on the time of the year. We can model this by introducing a time dependence in the birth and death rates. However this will lead to equations that will be difficult to analyse. Instead we can give up on the idea of modelling the population numbers continuously through time and instead only follow how the population changes from year to year.\nSo we will use models of the form \\[\nN_{t+1} = f(N_t)\n\\tag{2.1}\\] where \\(N_t\\) is the population number at time \\(t\\) and \\(f\\) is some function. Time \\(t\\) now takes on only integer values, and the population number is only defined at these times. This is called a discrete-time model. Given the initial population number \\(N_0\\), we can calculate the population number at any future time \\(t\\) by iterating the function \\(f\\): \\(N_1 = f(N_0)\\), \\(N_2 = f(N_1)=f(f(N_0)),\\ldots N_t = f(f(\\ldots f(N_0)\\ldots))\\).\nAfter completing this chapter, you should be able to:",

This is the discrete-time version of the continuous-time exponential model.

We need the extra factor of 1 year because \\(r\\) is a rate and has dimension 1/time.\nThe population number grows exponentially with time if \\(R&gt;1\\) and declines exponentially if \\(R&lt;1\\). To get more realistic models we again need to introduce a limited carrying capacity.\n\nExercise 2.1 (AER) You may be familiar with the distinction between the instantaneous rate \\(r\\) in a continuous-time model and the annual equivalent rate \\(R\\) in the corresponding discrete-time model from your savings account.

We will now introduce a graphical method for studying the stability of fixed points in discrete-time models, called the cobweb method.\nWe plot the function \\(f(N_t)\\) and the line \\(N_{t+1}=N_t\\). The fixed points are the intersection points of the function and the line. We then draw the graph of the sequence \\(N_t\\) by starting at the initial population number \\(N_0\\) and iterating the function \\(f(N_t)\\) to find \\(N_1\\), then iterating the function again to find \\(N_2\\), and so on. The graph of the sequence \\(N_t\\) is called the cobweb. The stability of the fixed points can be read off from the cobweb. If the cobweb spirals into the fixed point, as shown in Figure 2.1, then the fixed point is stable. If the cobweb spirals out of the fixed point, as shown in Figure 2.2, then the fixed point is unstable.

Ecologically, what is happening as the growth factor increases through \\(R=3\\) is that in a single year the population grows so much that it exceeds its carrying capacity. That then leads to unfavourable conditions in the following year, leading to a decrease below carrying capacity. Such oscillations in population numbers are not possible in a continuous-time model for a single un-structured population.\nIn Figure 2.1 the oscillations get damped over time and the system evolves towards a steady state. In Figure 2.1 the system evolves towards a state where the population number oscillates between two values. This is called a period-two orbit. We will have more to say about this in Section 2.7.\nThe graphical method for visualising the iterations will work also when the slope is positive at the fixed point, but it will not look like a cobweb because the system will not be oscillating around the fixed point but will be evolving towards it. Figure 2.3 shows the cobweb for a stable fixed point with positive slope \\(0&lt;f'(N^*)&lt;1\\) and Figure 2.4 shows the cobweb for an unstable fixed point with positive slope \\(f'(N^*)&gt;1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n      \n          \n      \n        \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n    \n    \n      \n      Once\n      \n      Loop\n      \n      Reflect\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Cobweb diagram for a stable fixed point with positive slope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n      \n          \n      \n        \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n    \n    \n      \n      Once\n      \n      Loop\n      \n      Reflect\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Cobweb diagram for an unstable fixed point with positive slope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.3 (+ Verhulst model) For some choices of the parameters, the Verhulst model \\[\nN_{t+1}=RN_t\\left(1-\\frac{N_t}{\\tilde{K}}\\right)\n\\tag{2.10}\\] can lead to negative population numbers even when initially starting with a positive population below its carrying capacity.

There are several other models that are discrete-time versions of the logistic model and do not have this problem. We will now look at the two most important of them.\n\n2.5.1 Ricker model\nMany fish species, like salmon, have distinct breeding seasons and their reproduction shows strong density dependence - when population density is too high, fewer offspring survive due to competition for spawning sites. The Ricker model captures this behavior through the equation:\n\\[\nN_{t+1} = N_t\\, e^{R_0\\left(1 - \\frac{N_t}{K}\\right)}.\n\\tag{2.11}\\]\nBy moving the logistic factor inside the exponential, the Ricker model prevents negative population numbers. The fixed points are still \\(N^*=0\\) and \\(N^*=K\\). Ricker introduced this model to describe salmon populations.\n\n\nExercise 2.4 (* Ricker model) Find the fixed points in the Ricker model \\[\nN_{t+1} = N_t\\, e^{R_0\\left(1 - \\frac{N_t}{K}\\right)}.\n\\tag{2.12}\\] and investigate their stability. Do this both analytically and by drawing cobweb diagrams. Allow also negative values of \\(R_0\\) in your analysis, even though this is not ecologically realistic. Note that you will then need at least three cobweb diagrams because there are then two bifurcations.\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Beverton-Holt model\nThe Beverton-Holt model, introduced by Ray Beverton and Sidney Holt in 1957, was developed to understand fish population dynamics. The model arose from their groundbreaking work on sustainable fisheries management while working at the Fisheries Laboratory in Lowestoft, UK. They were particularly interested in how the number of young fish (recruits) entering a population depends on the number of parent fish (spawning stock).\nThey proposed the model\n\\[\nN_{t+1} = \\frac{R N_t}{1 + \\frac{R-1}{K}N_t}.\n\\tag{2.13}\\]\nThis has been a very influential model in fisheries science. On the face of it the model does not look very similar to the logistic model, but we will see the relationship when we solve the model. The trick is to make a change of variables from \\(N_t\\) to \\(u_t = 1/N_t\\). Then we have \\[\nu_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{N_{t+1}} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{R-1}{K}N_t}{R N_t} = \\frac{u_t}{R} + \\frac{R-1}{R K}.\n\\tag{2.14}\\] This is a linear equation for \\(u_t\\), and linear equations are easy to solve. The easiest way to proceed is to look at the first few terms of the sequence \\(u_t\\) and guess the general form of the solution. We find \\[\\begin{split}\nu_1 &= \\frac{u_0}{R} + \\frac{R-1}{R K},\\\\\nu_2 &= \\frac{u_0}{R^2} + \\frac{R-1}{R K}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{R}\\right),\\\\\nu_3 &= \\frac{u_0}{R^3} + \\frac{R-1}{R K}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{R} + \\frac{1}{R^2}\\right),\\\\\n&\\vdots\\\\\nu_t &= \\frac{u_0}{R^t} + \\frac{R-1}{R K}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{R} + \\frac{1}{R^2} + \\ldots + \\frac{1}{R^{t-1}}\\right).\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{2.15}\\] The sum in the second term is a geometric series. We know the general formula for a geometric series: \\[\n1 + x + x^2 + \\ldots + x^{t-1} = \\frac{1 - x^t}{1 - x}.\n\\tag{2.16}\\]\nWe can use this with \\(x=1/R\\) to sum terms in the second term. We find \\[\nu_t = \\frac{u_0}{R^t} + \\frac{R-1}{R K}\\frac{1 - (1/R)^t}{1 - 1/R}.\n\\] We simplify this a bit and bring everything on the same denominator. \\[\nu_t = \\frac{u_0}{R^t} - \\frac{(1/R)^t-1}{K}\n=\\frac{Ku_0-1+R^t}{KR^t}.\n\\tag{2.17}\\]\nWe can now change back to \\(N_t=1/u_t\\) to find the solution to the Beverton-Holt model. We find \\[\n\\begin{split}\nN_t &= \\frac{1}{u_t}=\\frac{K R^t}{Ku_0-1+R^t}\\\\\n&=\\frac{K/u_0}{KR^{-t}-R^{-t}/u_0+1/u_0}\\\\\n&=\\frac{KN_0}{N_0+(K-N_0)R^{-t}}.\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{2.18}\\]\nThis is the solution to the Beverton-Holt model. Comparing this to the solution of the continuous-time logistic model from Eq. 1.5, \\[\nN(t) = \\frac{KN_0}{N_0+(K-N_0)\\exp(-rt)},\n\\tag{2.19}\\] we see that they agree at integer times \\(t\\) if we measure time in years and set \\(R=\\exp(r \\cdot 1\\text{ year}).\\)\n\n\nExercise 2.5 (Beverton-Holt model) Find the fixed points in the Beverton-Holt model \\[\nN_{t+1} = \\frac{R N_t}{1 + \\frac{R-1}{K}N_t}.\n\\tag{2.20}\\] and investigate their stability.

    "text": "2.6 Discrete-time harvesting model\nWe will now look at an example of a discrete-time model with harvesting and apply the techniques we have learned. The model has the standard discrete-time model form \\(N_{t+1}=f(N_t)\\), where \\(f\\) in our example is \\[\nf(N) = \\frac{b N^2}{1+N^2}-EN.\n\\] The constant \\(b&gt;2\\) determines the growth rate of the population and the harvesting rate is determined by the harvesting effort \\(E\\).\nWe start by studying the model without harvesting, so we set \\(E=0\\) for now. As usual, we start by looking at the steady states of the model. The fixed points are the solutions to the equation \\[\nN^* = \\frac{b\\,{N^*}^2}{1+{N^*}^2}.\n\\] There is the obvious solution \\(N^*=0\\). We can then find the non-zero solutions by dividing both sides by \\(N^*\\) and multiply them by \\(1+{N^*}^2\\) to get the equation \\[\n1+{N^*}^2 = bN^*.\n\\] This is a quadratic equation for \\(N^*\\), which we could rewrite in the more conventional form \\[\n{N^*}^2 - bN^* + 1 = 0.\n\\] The solutions to this equation are \\[\nN^*_\\pm = \\frac{b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4}}{2}.\n\\] The solutions are real if \\(b^2-4\\geq 0\\), i.e. if \\(b\\geq 2\\), which we have stipulated earlier. Both solutions are positive.\nWe now have enough information to draw a good sketch to understand the dynamics of the model. We can draw the function \\(f(N)\\) and the line \\(N_{t+1}=N_t\\). It may not be immediately obvious what the sketch of \\(f(N)=bN^2/(1+N^2)\\) looks like. We’ll reason ourselves through this in steps:\n\nFirst let us consider what happens near \\(N=0\\). There the function is approximately \\(f(N)\\approx bN^2\\). This is a parabola that opens upwards. The function is zero at \\(N=0\\) and increases quadratically with \\(N\\).\nNext we consider what happens as \\(N\\) becomes large. There the function is approximately \\(f(N)\\approx b\\). So the graph has a horizontal asymptote at \\(y=b\\).\nWe know that in between there are two fixed points. That means the graph needs to cross the diagonal line \\(y=N\\) twice.\nFinally we observe that the function is monotonically increasing.\n\nIf we now draw something that has all these features, we will have a sufficiently good sketch of the function for our purpose of understanding the dynamics of the model. We will necessarily end up with something that qualitatively looks like the graph in Figure 2.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Graph of the function \\(f(N)=\\frac{bN^2}{1+N^2}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing our cobweb technique, or simply looking at the slope of \\(f\\) at the fixed points, we can easily convince ourselves that the extinction fixed point is stable, the smaller non-zero fixed point \\(N^*_-\\) is unstable and the larger fixed point \\(N^*_+\\) is stable. in Figure 2.5 we have indicated the stable fixed points by solid circles and the unstable fixed points by open circles. So when the population number is larger than \\(N^*_-\\) it will grow towards \\(N^*_+\\), and when it is smaller than \\(N^*_-\\) it will go extinct. So this model exhibits a strong Allee effect with critical depensation. \\(N^*_-\\) is the smallest viable population size.\nWe can now add harvesting to the model. The extra term in the function \\(f(N)\\) is \\(-EN\\). This lowers the graph of \\(f(N)\\) by an amount that grows linearly with \\(N\\). This is illustrated in Figure 2.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Graph of the function \\(f(N)=\\frac{bN^2}{1+N^2}-EN\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that as the harvesting effort \\(E\\) increases, the two fixed points move closer together. At a critical value \\(E_c\\) the two fixed points merge and disappear. The population number will then go extinct for all initial population numbers.\nLet us find the critical value \\(E_c\\). For that we first determine the location of the fixed points in the presence of harvesting. So we solve the equation \\[\nN^* = \\frac{b\\,{N^*}^2}{1+{N^*}^2}-EN^*.\n\\] Again this has a solution \\(N^*=0\\). We can then find the non-zero solutions by dividing both sides by \\(N^*\\) and multiply them by \\(1+{N^*}^2\\) to get the equation \\[\n(1+E){N^*}^2-bN^*+1+E = 0.\n\\] This is solved by \\[\nN^*_\\pm = \\frac{\\frac{b}{1+E}\\pm\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{b}{1+E}\\right)^2-4}}{2}.\n\\]\nWe see that these solutions are real only if \\(\\left(\\frac{b}{1+E}\\right)^2-4\\geq 0\\), i.e., if \\(E&lt; \\frac{b-2}{2}\\). Thus the critical effort is \\(E_c=\\frac{b-2}{2}\\). Fishing above this level will lead to extinction of the population. But even fishing just near this level is risky because the population number will be very close to the minimum viable population and a small disturbance could lead to extinction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Bifurcation diagram for the discrete-time harvesting model.",

    "text": "2.7 Period-doubling route to chaos\nTake another look at Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2. Just a little change in the function \\(f(N)\\) changed the nature of the fixed point. Such a change can be the consequence of a small change in a model parameter, for example the intrinsic growth rate.\nWe will use the logistic map to illustrate the period-doubling route to chaos, although the phenomenon is more general. The logistic map is a simple discrete-time model for population growth that exhibits a period-doubling route to chaos. It is defined as \\[\nX_{t+1} = R\\,X_t\\,(1-X_t) =: f(X_t).\n\\] It is the same as the Verhulst model Eq. 2.6, just written in terms of \\(X_t = N_t/\\tilde{K}\\). Figure 2.8 shows the graph of \\(f(X)\\) of the Verhulst model at three different values of the intrinsic growth factor \\(R\\). For \\(R=2.8\\) the slope of \\(f\\) at the fixed point is less steep than \\(-1\\) and thus the fixed point is stable, as in Figure 2.1. For \\(R=3.2\\) the slope of \\(f\\) at the fixed point is steeper than \\(-1\\) and thus the fixed point is unstable and the population number starts to oscillate, as in Figure 2.2. At \\(R=3\\) the system switches from one behaviour to the other. That is the bifurcation point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Plot showing a period-doubling bifurcation in the Verhulst model.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9 shows a simplified bifurcation diagram for the Verhulst model. A bifurcation diagram shows the location of fixed points or periodic orbits, with stable fixed points or stable periodic orbits represented by solid lines and unstable fixed points or unstable periodic orbits represented by dashed lines. Reading the diagram from left to right, which corresponds to increasing growth factor \\(R\\) in the Verhulst model, we see how at first the stable fixed point (which is located at the carrying capacity \\(K\\)) moves towards larger population sizes. At \\(R=3\\) it becomes unstable and spawns a stable periodic orbit whose amplitude grows until that periodic orbit itself becomes unstable, in another period-doubling bifurcation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Bifurcation diagram for the period-doubling bifurcation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9 does not show the period 4 orbit that emerges when the period 2 orbit becomes unstable.

The period-doubling route to chaos, as seen in the logistic map, is a classic example of how simple nonlinear equations can produce complex and unpredictable behavior. How important chaos is for ecological systems is a subject of ongoing debate.",

You have met bifurcations in continuous-time models already in your Classical Dynamics module. You have seen there that in one-dimensional systems described by a single ODE there are three different types of bifurcation: saddle-node, pitchfork, transcritical. The same types of bifurcations can occur in discrete-time models and we will discuss and visualise each of these bifurcation types below. These bifurcations happen if there is a fixed point with \\(f'(N^*)=1\\). Then there is also one more type: the period-doubling bifurcation, which happens when \\(f'(N^*)=-1\\), and which we have met in Section 2.7.\n\n2.8.1 Saddle-node bifurcation\nWe have already seen a saddle-node bifurcation in the discrete-time harvesting mode, where two fixed points merge and disappear as the parameter is varied.

    "text": "3.1 Lotka-Volterra Model\nEcological systems are complex networks of interactions involving multiple species, which can be categorized into different trophic levels based on their roles in the ecosystem. Understanding these interactions is crucial for studying ecosystem dynamics, population control, and biodiversity. While the study of multiple interacting species can become quite intricate, analysing the interactions between two species offers a more manageable framework while still providing significant insights into the dynamics of ecological relationships. This chapter focuses on two-species interactions, offering a foundational understanding that can be applied or extended to more complex scenarios.\nMathematical Framework for Two-Species Interactions\nTo model the interactions between two species, we employ a system of two autonomous coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs). These equations describe the rate of change of the population sizes over time, capturing the essence of their interaction. The general form of these equations is given by: \\[\n\\frac{dX}{dt} = f(X,Y), ~~~~~ \\frac{dY}{dt} = g(X,Y).\n\\tag{3.1}\\] where \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) represent the population sizes of the two species, and \\(f(X,Y)\\) and \\(g(X,Y)\\) are functions that describe how the populations influence each other. These functions are crafted based on the nature of the interaction between the species, reflecting the underlying biological processes.\nTypes of Two-Species Interactions\nThe dynamics of two interacting species are generally categorized into three primary types, each with its unique characteristics and implications for the populations involved:\nWhile this chapter focuses on these primary interaction types, it’s important to recognize the spectrum of interactions in nature, including parasitism, amensalism, and others. Moreover, the real-world ecological systems often exhibit a mix of these interactions, adding layers of complexity. By starting with the analysis of two-species systems, we lay the groundwork for understanding more intricate interactions and the overall dynamics of ecosystems.\nThe Lotka-Volterra model, developed independently by Alfred Lotka in 1925 and Vito Volterra in 1926, serves as a foundational mathematical model for understanding the dynamic interplay between a prey population (denoted by \\(N\\)) and a predator population (denoted by \\(P\\)).\nModel Formulation\nThe model assumes that the prey population, in the absence of predators, grows exponentially with a per capita growth rate \\(a &gt; 0\\). However, the prey die due to being eaten by predators, and we assume that the per-capita mortality rate grows in proportion to the abundance of predators, with some proportionality constant \\(b \\geq 0\\). This leads to the equation \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = N(a - bP).\n\\tag{3.2}\\]\nConversely, the predators benefit from the abundance of prey and we encode that by giving them a per-capita growth \\(cN\\), where \\(c \\geq 0\\). We assume that the per capita mortality rate is a constant \\(d\\). This yields the following equation for the predator dynamics: \\[\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = P(cN - d).\n\\tag{3.3}\\]\nThe two plots in Figure 3.1 generated from the Lotka-Volterra model provide a visual representation of the dynamics between a predator and prey population over time. The phase plane plot illustrates the cyclic nature of the interaction between the prey (N) and predator (P) populations, depicting a closed trajectory that indicates the continuous oscillation of both populations in relation to each other: as the prey population increases, it provides more food for the predators, which then also increase in number. However, as the predator population grows, it puts more pressure on the prey, leading to a decline in the prey population, which eventually causes the predator population to decrease due to lack of food.\nThe plot at the bottom shows the prey and predator populations over time. It highlights the periodic rises and falls of each population, showing how the increase in the prey population precedes the increase in the predator population, followed by a subsequent decline in the prey and then the predator population. The time series plot complements the phase plane by showing how the dynamics unfold over time.\nFigure 3.1: Solutions to the Lotka-Volterra model with parameters \\(a = 1.0\\), \\(b = 0.1\\), \\(c = 0.1\\), and \\(d = 1.0\\) and initial conditions \\(N_0 = 10\\) and \\(P_0 = 5\\).\nNon-dimensionalization of the Model\nNon-dimensionalization is a crucial step to reduce the complexity of the model by decreasing the number of parameters, thereby simplifying the analysis. By introducing the non-dimensional variables \\(u = \\frac{cN}{d}\\), \\(v = \\frac{bP}{a}\\), and the non-dimensional time \\(\\tau = at\\), along with the parameter \\(\\alpha = \\frac{d}{a}\\), we can transform the Lotka-Volterra equations into a more tractable form:\n\\[\n\\frac{du}{d\\tau} = u(1 - v), \\quad \\frac{dv}{d\\tau} = \\alpha v(u - 1).\n\\tag{3.4}\\]\nPhase plane paths\nTo determine the phase plane paths we consider \\(v\\) as a function of \\(u\\) which satisfies the equation \\[\n\\frac{dv}{du} = \\frac{\\frac{dv}{d\\tau}}{\\frac{du}{d\\tau}} = \\frac{\\alpha v(u - 1)}{u(1 - v)}.\n\\tag{3.5}\\] We rewrite this by separating the variable and integrate: \\[\n\\int\\frac{1-v}{v}dv = \\alpha \\int\\frac{u-1}{u}du.\n\\tag{3.6}\\] This gives \\[\n\\log v - v - \\alpha (u - \\log u) = \\text{constant}.\n\\tag{3.7}\\] So even though \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are changing with time, this particular combination stays constant. This is a conserved quantity. Let us suggestively call the constant of the motion \\(H\\) for Hamiltonian and write it in terms of new variables \\(p = \\log u\\) and \\(q = \\log v\\): \\[\nH(q,p)= v- \\log v + \\alpha (u - \\log u) = e^q - q + \\alpha(e^p - p).\n\\tag{3.8}\\] Hamilton’s equations \\[\\dot{q} = \\frac{dH}{dp},~~~~\\dot{p} = -\\frac{dH}{dq} \\tag{3.9}\\] then reproduce our equations of motion.\nThis formulation underscores the conservative nature of the model, where the energy-like quantity \\(H\\) is conserved, leading to neutrally stable periodic orbits. This Hamiltonian nature is a rather special feature of the Lotka-Volterra model. Any slight modification of the model will destroy the conserved quantity and the periodic orbits. Thus we should not expect to see such perfect periodic predator-prey cycles in nature. We will discuss more realistic predator-prey models later.",

    "text": "3.2 Linear Stability Analysis\nBefore we study more realistic models, we revisit the concept of linear stability analysis, an essential tool in understanding the dynamics near the fixed points of systems described by autonomous coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the form\n\\[\n\\frac{dX}{dt} = f(X,Y), \\quad \\frac{dY}{dt} = g(X,Y).\n\\tag{3.10}\\]\nLet us denote the fixed points (stable states) of the system as \\((x^*, y^*)\\). They satisfy \\(f(x^*, y^*) = 0\\) and \\(g(x^*, y^*) = 0\\).\nLinearisation around the Fixed Points\nTo analyse the stability of these fixed points, we introduce small perturbations \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) around them, setting \\(X = x^* + x\\) and \\(Y = y^* + y\\). By applying a Taylor expansion and retaining only the linear terms, we obtain a linearised system:\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{A}(x^*, y^*) \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix},\n\\tag{3.11}\\] where the Jacobian matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is defined as: \\[\n\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} f_X & f_Y \\\\ g_X & g_Y \\end{pmatrix}_{(x^*, y^*)}.\n\\tag{3.12}\\]\nEigenvalue Analysis for Stability\nThe solution to the linearised system takes the form \\((x, y) = \\mathbf{v} e^{\\lambda t}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is an eigenvector of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), and \\(\\lambda\\) is the corresponding eigenvalue. By setting the determinant of \\(\\mathbf{A} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}\\) to zero, we obtain the characteristic equation:\n\\[\n\\det(\\mathbf{A} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = \\begin{vmatrix} f_X - \\lambda & f_Y \\\\ g_X & g_Y - \\lambda \\end{vmatrix}_{(x^*, y^*)} = 0,\n\\tag{3.13}\\] which leads to the eigenvalues: \\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\text{Tr} \\mathbf{A} \\pm \\sqrt{(\\text{Tr} \\mathbf{A})^2 - 4\\det \\mathbf{A}}}{2}.\n\\tag{3.14}\\]\nThe stability of the fixed point is determined by the sign of the real parts of the eigenvalues:\n\nIf both eigenvalues have negative real parts, the fixed point is stable (attracting).\nIf both eigenvalues have positive real parts, the fixed point is unstable (repelling).\nIf the eigenvalues have real parts of opposite signs, the fixed point is a saddle point, which is unstable.\nFor a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues, if the real part is positive, the system exhibits an unstable spiral; if the real part is negative, the system exhibits a stable spiral.\n\nThis analysis is pivotal for understanding how small deviations from equilibrium evolve over time, providing insights into the system’s long-term behaviour near the fixed points. For instance, in the context of the predator-prey dynamics, such analysis helps elucidate under what conditions the populations will return to equilibrium after a disturbance or potentially diverge away from it.\nWe can reformulate the stability conditions of a fixed point in terms of the determinant and trace of the Jacobian matrix. We need to recall how these two characteristics of the Jacobian relate to the eigenvalues. For a 2x2 matrix \\(A\\) with eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\), the trace \\(\\text{Tr}(A)\\) is the sum of the eigenvalues, and the determinant \\(\\text{Det}(A)\\) is the product of the eigenvalues:\n\n\\(\\text{Tr}(A) = \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2\\)\n\\(\\text{Det}(A) = \\lambda_1 \\lambda_2\\)\n\nUsing these relationships, we can express the conditions for the stability of fixed points as follows:\n\nStable (Attracting) Fixed Point: If both eigenvalues have negative real parts, their sum (the trace) is negative, and their product (the determinant) is positive because the product of two negative numbers is positive. Therefore, for stability, \\(\\text{Tr}(A) &lt; 0\\) and \\(\\text{Det}(A) &gt; 0\\). Additionally, to ensure that both eigenvalues are real and negative, we require that \\(\\text{Tr}(A)^2 - 4\\text{Det}(A) \\geq 0\\) to avoid complex eigenvalues.\nUnstable (Repelling) Fixed Point: If both eigenvalues have positive real parts, the trace is positive, and the determinant is positive (the product of two positive numbers is positive). Thus, for instability, \\(\\text{Tr}(A) &gt; 0\\) and \\(\\text{Det}(A) &gt; 0\\).\nSaddle Point (Unstable): If the eigenvalues have real parts of opposite signs, the determinant (the product of the eigenvalues) is negative. So, for a saddle point, \\(\\text{Det}(A) &lt; 0\\), regardless of the trace.\nSpiral Points: For a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues, the determinant will be positive (since the product of complex conjugates is positive), but the stability depends on the sign of the real part of the eigenvalues, which is represented by the trace. Here, we also need to ensure that \\(\\text{Tr}(A)^2 - 4\\text{Det}(A) &lt; 0\\) to confirm that the eigenvalues are complex.\n\nUnstable Spiral: If the real part is positive, \\(\\text{Tr}(A) &gt; 0\\) and \\(\\text{Det}(A) &gt; 0\\).\nStable Spiral: If the real part is negative, \\(\\text{Tr}(A) &lt; 0\\) and \\(\\text{Det}(A) &gt; 0\\).\n\n\nThese conditions provide a concise way to determine the stability of fixed points using only the determinant and trace of the Jacobian matrix, without explicitly computing the eigenvalues.\n\nExample 3.1 (Linear Stability Analysis of the Lotka-Volterra Model) To explore the stability of steady states in the Lotka-Volterra model, we analyse the system near its fixed points using the Jacobian matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). For the non-dimensionalized Lotka-Volterra system, the Jacobian matrix is given by \\[\n\\mathbf{A} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 - v & -u \\\\\n\\alpha v & \\alpha (u - 1)\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\tag{3.15}\\]\nSteady State at \\((u, v) = (0, 0)\\)\nFor the fixed point \\((u, v) = (0, 0)\\), we substitute these values into the Jacobian matrix and find the eigenvalues:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -\\alpha\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\tag{3.16}\\]\nThe eigenvalues are \\(\\lambda_1 = 1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2 = -\\alpha\\), indicating that this fixed point is a saddle point due to the eigenvalues having opposite signs.

    "text": "3.3 More Realistic Predator-Prey Models\nWhile the basic Lotka-Volterra model provides a fundamental understanding of predator-prey interactions, more nuanced models incorporate additional biological realism. These models may account for factors like limited resources, satiation, prey switching, predator avoidance, and many others.\n\n3.3.1 Generalized Predator-Prey Model\nThe generalized model introduces a function \\(F(N, P)\\) representing the prey population’s per-capita growth and a function \\(G(N, P)\\) for the predator’s per-capita growth rate, so that the dynamics are:\n\\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = NF(N, P), \\quad \\frac{dP}{dt} = PG(N, P).\n\\tag{3.18}\\]\nThe prey might exhibit logistic growth in the absence of predators. To model this we could choose \\[\nF(N, P) = r\\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right) - R(N)P,\n\\tag{3.19}\\]\nwhere \\(r\\) is the intrinsic growth rate, \\(K\\) is the carrying capacity, and \\(R(N)\\) models how the predation rate of a predator changes with the prey population size. \\(NR(N)\\) is the rate at which each individual predator consumes prey. The dependence of this rate on the prey population size \\(N\\) is often referred to as “functional response” in the ecological literature. Holling introduced three types of functional responses, which are widely used in predator-prey models:\n\nHolling Type functional responses\n\nType I \\(NR(N) = bN\\), which corresponds to the standard Lotka-Volterra model. This simplification lacks realism as it assumes an unlimited predator appetite regardless of prey population size.\nType II \\(NR(N) = \\frac{AN}{N + B}\\), with \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) being positive constants. In this model, the rate approaches a saturation level \\(A\\) for large \\(N\\), reflecting a limit to the predator’s consumption rate. This model is more realistic as it accounts for the predator’s limited appetite, which might be because there is a minimum handling time, the time the predator needs to consume a prey item.\nType III \\(NR(N) = \\frac{AN^2}{N^2 + B^2}\\). This response includes a saturation effect like the previous example but also models that if the prey is rare the predator may not be able to find it. This model is more complex and captures the idea that predators may switch to alternative prey when the primary prey is scarce. It may also encode a learning effect, where the predator’s efficiency in capturing prey increases with experience so that initially the predator’s consumption rate increases with prey density.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Example\nConsider a model where the prey growth rate follows logistic dynamics in the absence of prey and predation mortality is described by a Holling type II function encoding satiation effects. The predator’s growth rate goes down as the prey population decreases. The model equations are: \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = N\\left[r\\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right) - \\frac{A}{N + B}P\\right], \\quad \\frac{dP}{dt} = Ps\\left(1 - \\frac{hP}{N}\\right),\n\\tag{3.20}\\] where \\(r\\), \\(K\\), \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(s\\), and \\(h\\) are positive constants.\nNondimensionalization\nTo reduce the complexity, we nondimensionalize the system with \\(\\tau = tr\\), \\(u = \\frac{N}{K}\\), \\(v = \\frac{hP}{K}\\), \\(a = \\frac{A}{hr}\\), \\(b = \\frac{B}{K}\\), and \\(c = \\frac{s}{r}\\), leading to:\n\\[\n\\frac{du}{d\\tau} = u(1 - u) - a\\frac{uv}{u + b}, \\quad \\frac{dv}{d\\tau} = cv\\left(1 - \\frac{v}{u}\\right).\n\\tag{3.21}\\]\nStability Analysis of Steady States\nThe steady states \\((u^*, v^*)\\) include \\((1, 0)\\) and a coexistence steady state \\((u^*_+, u^*_+)\\), where \\[\nu^*_+ = \\frac{1-a-b+\\sqrt{(1-a-b)^2+4b}}{2}.\n\\tag{3.22}\\] The community matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}(u, v)\\) at these points helps determine their stability. For the fixed point \\((1, 0)\\), where the prey population is at carrying capacity and there are no predators, we have find \\[\n\\mathbf{A}(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -\\frac{a}{1 + b} \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\tag{3.23}\\] The eigenvalues \\(-1\\) and \\(c\\) have opposite sign, indicating that the fixed point is a saddle point.\nAt the coexistence fixed point \\((u^*_+, u^*_+)\\) the Jacobian is more complex and we will skip the analysis here.",

    "text": "3.4 Competition Models\nIn ecological systems, species often compete for limited resources, such as food or territory. This competition influences their growth rates and can determine their survival and dominance within an ecosystem. The Lotka-Volterra competition model provides a framework to study these dynamics, extending the principles of logistic growth to account for interspecies interactions.\n\n3.4.1 Lotka-Volterra Competition Dynamics\nThe model is formulated as follows for two competing species \\(N_1\\) and \\(N_2\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\frac{dN_1}{dt} &= r_1N_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{N_1 + b_{12}N_2}{K_1}\\right),\\\\\n\\frac{dN_2}{dt} &= r_2N_2 \\left(1 - \\frac{N_2 + b_{21}N_1}{K_2}\\right),\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{3.24}\\]\nwhere \\(r_i\\) is the intrinsic growth rate and \\(K_i\\) is the carrying capacity of species \\(i\\). The coefficients \\(b_{ij}\\) represent the competitive effect of species \\(j\\) on species \\(i\\), effectively reducing the carrying capacity for species \\(i\\) due to the presence of species \\(j\\).\n\n\n3.4.2 Nondimensionalization of the Model\nTo simplify the analysis, we nondimensionalize the system using:\n\\[\nu_i = \\frac{N_i}{K_i}, \\quad a_{ij} = \\frac{b_{ij}K_j}{K_i}, \\quad \\tau = r_1 t, \\quad \\rho = \\frac{r_2}{r_1},\n\\tag{3.25}\\] leading to: \\[\n\\frac{du_1}{d\\tau} = u_1(1 - u_1 - a_{12}u_2), ~~~~~ \\frac{du_2}{d\\tau} = \\rho u_2(1 - u_2 - a_{21}u_1).\n\\tag{3.26}\\]\n\n\n3.4.3 Analysis of Steady States\nThe system has four potential steady states: \\((0, 0)\\), \\((0, 1)\\), \\((1, 0)\\), and a coexistence steady state \\(\\left(\\frac{1-a_{12}}{1-a_{12}a_{21}}, \\frac{1-a_{21}}{1-a_{12}a_{21}}\\right)\\).\nTo determine the stability of these points, we evaluate the Jacobian matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}(u_1, u_2)\\) at each steady state and analyse its eigenvalues:\n\nAt \\((0, 0)\\): The eigenvalues are \\(1\\) and \\(\\rho\\), indicating an unstable node as both are positive.\nAt \\((1, 0)\\): The eigenvalues are \\(-1\\) and \\(\\rho(1 - a_{21})\\). This point is a saddle if \\(a_{21} &lt; 1\\) and a stable node if \\(a_{21} &gt; 1\\).\nAt \\((0, 1)\\): By symmetry, this point behaves like \\((1, 0)\\) with roles reversed between species.\nCoexistence point \\(\\left(\\frac{1-a_{12}}{1-a_{12}a_{21}}, \\frac{1-a_{21}}{1-a_{12}a_{21}}\\right)\\): The stability is determined by the sign of the trace and the determinant of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). The system’s behaviour at this point depends on the specific values of \\(a_{12}\\) and \\(a_{21}\\), indicating potential scenarios where both species can coexist or one outcompetes the other.\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Nullclines and Phase Portraits\nNullclines, where the growth rate of one of the species are zero, are a very useful aid when drawing phase plane diagrams, also known as phase portraits. The nullclines for the Lotka-Volterra competition model are:\n\n\\(u_1\\) nullclines: \\(du_1/d\\tau = 0\\) when \\(u_1 = 0\\) or \\(u_2 = \\frac{1-u_1}{a_{12}}\\).\n\\(u_2\\) nullclines: \\(du_2/d\\tau = 0\\) when \\(u_2 = 0\\) or \\(u_2 = 1 - a_{21}u_1\\).\n\nAlong the \\(u_1\\) nullclines the flow is purely vertical and along the \\(u_2\\) nullclines the flow is purely horizontal. The intersection of the nullclines gives the steady states of the system. We can now draw the phase portrait to visualize the dynamics of the system. Very rough sketches are enough to understand the dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Phase portrait of competition model when \\(a_{12}&lt;1\\) and \\(a_{21}&lt;1\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2 shows the phase portrait of the competition model when \\(a_{12}&lt;1\\) and \\(a_{21}&lt;1\\). The nullclines are shown in grey and red, the flow lines in blue, with the arrows indicating the direction of the flow. The system exhibits a stable coexistence steady state, where both species persist in the ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Phase portrait of competition model when \\(a_{12}&gt;1\\) and \\(a_{21}&gt;1\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3 illustrates the phase portrait of the competition model when \\(a_{12}&gt;1\\) and \\(a_{21}&gt;1\\). In this scenario, the coexistence steady state is a saddle, leading to the exclusion of one species. Which species dominates depends on the initial conditions. If the initial condition is below the separatrix, species 1 will dominate, and if it is above, species 2 will dominate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Phase portrait of competition model when \\(a_{12}&lt;1\\) and \\(a_{21}&gt;1\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4 depicts the phase portrait of the competition model when \\(a_{12}&lt;1\\) and \\(a_{21}&gt;1\\). In this case, the coexistence steady state has disappeared (it has moved into a region with negative population numbers that is not ecologically relevant). Irrespective of initial conditions, the system will evolve towards the state where only species 1 exists. Species 2 is driven to extinction.\nWe are not drawing the case \\(a_{12}&gt;1\\) and \\(a_{21}&lt;1\\) as it is similar to the case \\(a_{12}&lt;1\\) and \\(a_{21}&gt;1\\) just with the role of species 1 and 2 reversed. In this case species 2 will dominate and species 1 will go extinct.\n\n\n3.4.5 Competitive Exclusion Principle\nThe competitive exclusion principle, proposed by Gause in the 1930s, states that two species competing for the same resources cannot coexist indefinitely, with one species eventually outcompeting the other.\nIn the model we studied the two species shared resources but each also had its own resources, hence we observed a weaker form of the competitive exclusion principle. The coexistence steady state was stable when the competition was weak enough, allowing both species to persist in the ecosystem. This highlights the delicate balance between competition and coexistence in ecological systems, where the strength of interspecies interactions plays a crucial role in determining the long-term dynamics of species populations.",

An example is the relationship between plants and their seed dispersers, such as insects, where both parties gain advantages from their association.\n\n3.5.1 Example\nThis model incorporates logistic growth, akin to the competition model, but with a twist to account for the mutualistic interaction:\n\\[\n\\frac{dN_1}{dt} = r_1N_1 \\left[ 1 - \\frac{N_1}{K_1} + b_{12}\\frac{N_2}{K_1} \\right], ~~~~~ \\frac{dN_2}{dt} = r_2N_2 \\left[ 1 - \\frac{N_2}{K_2} + b_{21}\\frac{N_1}{K_2} \\right],\n\\tag{3.27}\\]\nwhere \\(r_i\\), \\(K_i\\), and \\(b_{ij}\\) are all positive constants, with \\(b_{ij}\\) representing the mutualistic benefit to species \\(i\\) from species \\(j\\).

The nullclines are shown in grey and red, with the flow lines in blue. The system exhibits a stable coexistence steady state, where both species benefit from the mutualistic interaction.\n\n\n3.5.5 Limitations and Unbounded Growth\nA cautionary note is that if the mutualistic coefficients \\(a_{12}a_{21}\\) are too large, leading to \\(\\delta &lt; 0\\), the model predicts unbounded growth, which is unrealistic. This phenomenon, known as May’s “orgy of mutual benefaction,” highlights the need for constraints in mutualism models to avoid predicting ecological impossibilities.\nThrough this mutualism model, we gain insights into how species interactions can foster increased growth and stability, contrasting with competitive dynamics. It underscores the diversity of ecological interactions and their varying implications for species survival and community structure.",

This is a first-order linear ODE with time-dependent inhomogeneity. We can solve it by the method of integrating factors. We first rewrite it in the form \\[\n\\frac{dM}{dt}+\\mu_M M=b_M F_0\\,e^{(-\\mu_F+b_F)t}\n\\tag{4.14}\\] and then observe that the left-hand side is proportional to a total derivative: \\[\n\\frac{dM}{dt}+\\mu_M M=\\frac{d}{dt}(e^{\\mu_M t}M)e^{-\\mu_M t}\n\\tag{4.15}\\] Thus after multiplying both sides by \\(e^{\\mu_M t}\\) we get \\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}(e^{\\mu_M t}M)=b_M F_0\\,e^{(\\mu_M-\\mu_F+b_F)t}.\n\\tag{4.16}\\] We can now integrate both sides to get \\[\ne^{\\mu_M t}M(t)-e^{\\mu_M t}M_0=\\frac{b_M F_0}{\\mu_M-\\mu_F+b_F}\\left(e^{(\\mu_M-\\mu_F+b_F)t}-1\\right).\n\\tag{4.17}\\] This can be solved for \\(M(t)\\): \\[\nM(t)=M_0+\\frac{b_M F_0}{\\mu_M-\\mu_F+b_F}\\left(e^{(-\\mu_F+b_F)t}-e^{-\\mu_M t}\\right).\n\\tag{4.18}\\] We have been able to fully solve this model. At this stage it is worth checking that the dependence of the solution on the parameters and on the initial conditions is reasonable.\nNext let us take a look at the sex ratio as \\(t\\to\\infty\\). Of course this only makes sense in the case where \\(b_F\\geq \\mu+F\\) because otherwise, according to Eq. 4.12, the females go extinct and then so do the males. With \\(b_F\\geq \\mu+F\\) we find \\[\\begin{split}\ns=\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\frac{M(t)}{F(t)}\n&=\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\frac{M_0+\\frac{b_M F_0}{\\mu_M-\\mu_F+b_F}\\left(e^{(-\\mu_F+b_F)t}-e^{-\\mu_M t}\\right)}{F_0e^{(-\\mu_F+b_F)t}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{b_M}{b_F-\\mu_F+\\mu_M}.\n\\end{split} \\tag{4.19}\\]\nJust for fun let us check what this model would predict for the sex ratio in the population of the US, using data about births and deaths from 1992. \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mu_F&=807/100,000/\\text{year}, ~~~\\mu_M=902/100,000/\\text{year},\\\\\nb_F&=1480/100,000/\\text{year}, ~~~b_M=1550/100,000/\\text{year}.\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{4.20}\\] Substituting these values into Eq. 4.19 we get \\(s \\approx 0.9841\\). The actual ratio in the US in 1992 was \\(0.953\\). Of course this is not to be taken seriously. To start with, human populations are not solely female-limited. But there are many other criticisms that can be made of this model when applied to human populations.",

    "text": "4.3 Harmonic mean model\nWe will now consider a model where the birth rate depends on both the number of males and the number of females. We choose to set \\(\\varphi(F,M)\\) to a weighted average of \\(F\\) and \\(M\\): \\[\n\\varphi(F,M)=D\\,M+(1-D)F\n\\tag{4.21}\\] with some suitably chosen weighting factor \\(D\\). We want to keep the feature that when there is an over-abundance of males, then the birth rate is limited mostly by the number of females and vice versa. So we choose \\(D=M/(F+M)\\), which is the relative abundance of males. This makes \\(1-D=F/(F+M)\\), which is the relative abundance of females. This gives \\[\n\\varphi(F,M)=\\frac{M}{F+M}F+\\frac{F}{F+M}M=\\frac{2FM}{F+M}.\n\\tag{4.22}\\] We can now use this in the ODEs for \\(F\\) and \\(M\\): \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\frac{dF}{dt} &= -\\mu_F F+b_F\\frac{2FM}{F+M},\\\\\n\\frac{dM}{dt} &= -\\mu_M M+b_M\\frac{2FM}{F+M}.\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{4.23}\\] We will not try to solve this coupled system of non-linear ODEs. Instead we will directly look at the long-term sex ratio. We can derive an ODE for the sex ration \\(M/F\\): \\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\frac{M}{F}=\\frac{\\frac{dM}{dt}F-M\\frac{dF}{dt}}{F^2}.\n\\tag{4.24}\\] Because we are only interested in the long-term behaviour we look at the fixed point of this equation, hence we set the left-hand side to zero. We then get \\[\n\\frac{dM}{dt}F-M\\frac{dF}{dt}=0.\n\\tag{4.25}\\] We can now use the ODEs for \\(F\\) and \\(M\\) to get \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\frac{dM}{dt}F-M\\frac{dF}{dt}=&\\left(-\\mu_M M+b_M\\frac{2FM}{F+M}\\right)F\\\\\n&-M\\left(-\\mu_F F+b_F\\frac{2FM}{F+M}\\right)=0.\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{4.26}\\] We multiply by \\(F+M\\) and divide by \\(FM\\) to get \\[\n-\\mu_M(F+M)+2b_MF+\\mu_F(F+M)-2b_FM=0.\n\\tag{4.27}\\] Collecting terms proportional to \\(F\\) and \\(M\\) we get \\[\n(-\\mu_M+2b_M+\\mu_F)F=(\\mu_M-\\mu_F+2b_F)M.\n\\tag{4.28}\\] We can now solve this equation for the asymptotic sex ratio \\[\ns=\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\frac{M(t)}{F(t)}=\\frac{\\mu_M-\\mu_F+2b_F}{-\\mu_M+2b_M+\\mu_F}.\n\\tag{4.29}\\]\nEven though the sex ratio approaches a fixed point as \\(t\\to\\infty\\), the population numbers themselves do not. Once the sex ratio has settled to the value \\(s\\), we have \\(M=sF\\) and we can use this to get a single ODE for \\(F\\): \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\frac{dF}{dt}&=-\\mu_F F+b_F\\frac{2MF}{F+M}\\\\\n&=-\\mu_F F+\\frac{2s}{s+1}b_FF\\\\\n&=rF\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{4.30}\\] where \\[\nr=-\\mu_F+b_F\\frac{2s}{s+1}=\\frac{2b_Mb_F-\\mu_Mb_F-\\mu_Fb_M}{b_M+b_F}.\n\\] This is a linear equation and has the solution \\[\nF(t)=F_0e^{rt}.\n\\tag{4.31}\\]\nSo we have an exponential growth model for both \\(F\\) and \\(M\\), but the exponent has a modified birth rate that takes the sex ratio into account.\nTo arrive at more realistic models we should introduce a carrying capacity into the model.",

    "section": "5.1 Discrete time model",
    "text": "5.1 Discrete time model\nAs we discussed in Chapter 2, a discrete-time model is the natural choice if reproduction is an annual event, taking place in a short breeding season for example. We will now introduce a discrete-time age-structured population model. We will derive the model and then study the long-term behaviour of the population and its age distribution.\n\n5.1.1 Model description\nBoth time and age will be discrete variables. We will take them to be integers counting years. We will describe the population by the numbers \\(N_{a,t}\\) of individuals of age \\(a\\) at time \\(t\\), with \\(a\\) and \\(t\\) both integers and \\(a\\geq 0\\). The total number \\(N_t\\) of individuals in the population at time \\(t\\) is then given by the sum of \\(N_{a,t}\\) over all ages.\nThe parameters of our model will be the probabilities \\(S_a\\) of surviving from age \\(a\\) to age \\(a+1\\) and the number of offspring \\(b_a\\) produced by an individual when they reach age \\(a\\). Because the number of individuals at age \\(a\\) at time \\(t+1\\) is the number of individuals that a year earlier were at age \\(a-1\\) and have survived to age \\(a\\), we have \\[\nN_{a,t+1} = S_{a-1} N_{a-1,t}\n\\tag{5.1}\\] for \\(a=1,2,\\dots\\).\nWhen individuals reach age \\(a\\), they each produce \\(b_a\\) offspring. The total number of offspring produced at time \\(t\\) is therefore obtained by summing over all ages \\(a\\) the number of individuals at age \\(a\\) at time \\(t\\) times the number of offspring produced by an individual of age \\(a\\): \\[\nN_{0,t} = \\sum_{a=1}^\\infty b_a N_{a,t}.\n\\tag{5.2}\\]\nIn Eq. 5.2 both sides of the equation are at time \\(t\\). That is because reproduction is taken to happen instantaneously at the start of year \\(t\\). It is conventional to use Eq. 5.1 to rewrite Eq. 5.2 as an equation for \\(N_{0,t+1}\\): \\[\nN_{0,t+1} = \\sum_{a=1}^\\infty b_a N_{a,t+1}= \\sum_{a=1}^\\infty b_a S_{a-1} N_{a-1,t}\n= \\sum_{a=1}^\\infty F_{a-1} N_{a-1,t},\n\\tag{5.3}\\] where we have introduced the fecundity \\[\nF_a:=b_{a+1} S_{a}.\n\\]\nEq. 5.1 and Eq. 5.3 are the equations for the discrete-time age-structured population model. They are a system of coupled difference equations, one equation for each age class. Let us write them out again more explicitly: \\[\n\\begin{split}\nN_{0,t+1}&=F_0 N_{0,t}+F_1N_{1,t}+\\cdots +F_{m-1}N_{m-1}+F_{m}N_{m}+\\cdots, \\\\\nN_{1,t+1}&=S_0 N_{0,t}, \\\\\nN_{2,t+1}&=S_1 N_{1,t}, \\\\\n&\\vdots \\\\\nN_{m-1,t+1}&=S_{m-2} N_{m-2,t}, \\\\\nN_{m,t+1}&=S_{m-1} N_{m-1,t}, \\\\\n&\\vdots\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{5.4}\\] Annoyingly, the equation for \\(N_{0,t+1}\\) couples all these infinitely many equations together. We would like to solve these coupled equations to determine the numbers \\(N_{a,t}\\) of individuals at each age at each time, given the initial numbers \\(N_{a,0}\\) for all ages \\(a\\) at time \\(t=0\\). This can generally not be done analytically.\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Leslie matrix\nSo far we have dealt with an infinite set of age classes. However there are two situations where we can reduce the infinite set of equations Eq. 5.4 to a finite set. In those cases we can rewrite the equations in matrix form and analyse them using matrix algebra.\nThe first situation where only a finite number of equations is coupled together is when there is a maximal age \\(m\\) beyond which there is no reproduction, either because \\(b_a = 0\\) for \\(a&gt;m\\) or because there are no older individuals because \\(S_{m} = 0\\). In this case we can collect the equations for \\(N_{a,t+1}\\) for \\(a=0,1,2,\\ldots,m-1\\) into the matrix equation \\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nN_{0} \\\\\nN_{1} \\\\\nN_{2} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nN_{m-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}_{t+1}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nF_0 & F_1 & \\cdots & F_{m-2} & F_{m-1} \\\\\nS_0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & S_1 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\cdots & S_{m-2} & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nN_{0} \\\\\nN_{1} \\\\\nN_{2} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nN_{m-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}_{t}.\n\\tag{5.5}\\] The matrix on the right-hand side is called the Leslie matrix.\nWe can represent this Leslie matrix with the directed graph in Figure 5.1. The graph has one node for each age class \\(a=0,1,2,\\ldots,m-1\\) and a directed edge from node \\(i\\) to node \\(j\\) if and only if the Leslie matrix has a non-zero entry in column \\(i\\) and row \\(j\\). The graph is called the Leslie graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Leslie graph when there is no reproduction from ages greater than \\(m\\).\n\n\n\nNote that we did not need to include the age class \\(m\\) because it is not needed to calculate the reproduction because \\(F_m=b_{m+1}S_{m}=0\\). Once the matrix equation Eq. 5.5 is solved, we can determine \\(N_{m,t+1}\\) separately from Eq. 5.1 if we are interested, and similarly for all older age classes that do not reproduce, if any.\nLet us denote the Leslie matrix by \\(L\\). The equations Eq. 5.5 and Eq. 5.12 are matrix equations of the form \\[\n\\mathbf{N}_{t+1} = L\\, \\mathbf{N}_t,\n\\tag{5.6}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{N}_t\\) is the column vector of the numbers \\(N_{a,t}\\) and \\(L\\) is the Leslie matrix.\n\n\nExample 5.1 Consider a population with the reproduction numbers \\(b_a\\) and the survival probabilities \\(S_a\\) given in the following table:\n\n\n\n\\(a\\)\n\\(b_a\\)\n\\(S_a\\)\n\\(F_a\\)\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n1\n0\n1/2\n1/2\n\n\n2\n1\n1/2\n1\n\n\n3\n2\n1/2\n0\n\n\n4\n0\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\n\n5\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\n\n\nThe final column in that table is calculated from the previous ones using \\(F_a:=b_{a+1}S_{a}\\). In this example the maximum age \\(m\\) beyond which there is no reproduction is \\(m=3\\). Hence the corresponding Leslie matrix is a \\(3\\times 3\\) matrix. It is given by \\[\nL = \\begin{pmatrix}\nF_0&F_1&F_2 \\\\\nS_0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & S_1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1/2 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1/2 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\tag{5.7}\\]\nAssume that the at time \\(t=0\\) we only have 10 individuals all of age 0, i.e., \\[\n\\mathbf{N}_0 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n10 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\tag{5.8}\\] We can then calculate the numbers at the following times \\(t=1,2,3,\\ldots\\) by repeated multiplication by the Leslie matrix \\(L\\): \\[\n\\mathbf{N}_1 = L \\mathbf{N}_0 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1/2 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1/2 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n10 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n10 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\] \\[\n\\mathbf{N}_2 = L \\mathbf{N}_1\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n5 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n5\n\\end{pmatrix},\n~~~\n\\mathbf{N}_3 = L \\mathbf{N}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n5 \\\\\n5 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\cdots.\n\\tag{5.9}\\] Continuing like this (using a computer) we observe that the population converges to a stable age distribution. \\[\n\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\mathbf{N}_t = \\begin{pmatrix}\n4 \\\\\n4 \\\\\n2\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\tag{5.10}\\] This means that the population will eventually consist of \\(4\\) individuals of age \\(0\\), \\(4\\) individuals of age \\(1\\), and \\(2\\) individuals of age \\(2\\). We can calculate the number of older individuals as follows \\(N_{3,t} = S_2 N_{2,t} = 1, N_{4,t}=S_3N_{3,t}=1/2,\\cdots\\) as \\(t\\to\\infty\\).\n\n\nThe other situation where we only need a finite number of age classes is where the survival probabilities and the reproduction numbers are constant for all ages above a certain age \\(m-1\\). We can then collapse all individuals of age \\(m\\) or larger into the same age class \\(m\\). The survivors from age class \\(m\\) are thus put back into the same age class \\(m\\). This modifies the equation for \\(N_{m,t+1}\\) to \\[\nN_{m,t+1} = S_{m-1} N_{m-1,t} + S_{m} N_{m,t}.\n\\tag{5.11}\\] In this case we can write the model as a matrix equation of the form \\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nN_{0} \\\\\nN_{1} \\\\\nN_{2} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nN_{m}\n\\end{pmatrix}_{t+1}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nF_0 & F_1 & \\cdots & F_{m-1} & F_{m} \\\\\nS_0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & S_1 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\cdots & S_{m-1} & S_m\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nN_{0} \\\\\nN_{1} \\\\\nN_{2} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nN_{m}\n\\end{pmatrix}_{t}.\n\\tag{5.12}\\] Now \\(N_{m,t}\\) is the number of all individuals of age \\(m\\) or older at time \\(t\\). We can represent this Leslie matrix with the graph in Figure 5.2 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Leslie graph when the last age class contains all individuals with age \\(\\geq m\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Stable age distribution\nThe phenomenon that we observed in Example 5.1 that the age distribution settles down to a stable age distribution as time goes on is a general phenomenon. To understand it we will now look for a solution of the form \\[\nN_{a,t} = \\lambda^t r_a\n\\tag{5.13}\\] This is a solution in which the age distribution \\(r_a\\) remains stable from one year to the next, but the total population grows or shrinks by a factor \\(\\lambda\\) each year. It was untypical that in Example 5.1 we had \\(\\lambda=1\\) so that the population neither grew nor shrank.\nThe Ansatz Eq. 5.13 means in particular that, for this solution, \\(N_{a,t+1} = \\lambda N_{a,t}\\) for all ages \\(a\\). For \\(a=1\\) this gives \\[\nN_{1,t+1} = \\lambda N_{1,t} = S_0 N_{0,t}\n\\tag{5.14}\\] and hence \\[\nN_{1,t} = \\frac{S_0}{\\lambda} N_{0,t}.\n\\tag{5.15}\\] Similarly we can express \\(N_{2,t}\\) in terms of \\(N_{0,t}\\): \\[\nN_{2,t} = \\frac{S_1}{\\lambda} N_{1,t} = \\frac{S_1 S_0}{\\lambda^2} N_{0,t}.\n\\tag{5.16}\\] We can continue this process to express \\(N_{a,t}\\) in terms of \\(N_{0,t}\\): \\[\nN_{a,t} = \\frac{S_{a-1}S_{a-2}\\cdots S_0}{\\lambda^a} N_{0,t}= \\frac{l_{a}}{\\lambda^a} N_{0,t}\n\\tag{5.17}\\] where \\[\nl_a=S_{a-1}S_{a-2}\\cdots S_0.\n\\tag{5.18}\\] is the probability of surviving from age \\(0\\) to age \\(a\\).\nFinally, for the newborns we have \\[\nN_{0,t+1} = \\lambda N_{0,t} = \\sum_{a=1}^\\infty F_{a-1} N_{a-1,t} = \\sum_{a=1}^\\infty F_{a-1} \\frac{l_{a-1}}{\\lambda^{a-1}} N_{0,t}.\n\\tag{5.19}\\] Dividing the equation by \\(\\lambda N_{0,t}\\) gives \\[\n1 = \\sum_{a=1}^\\infty F_{a-1}\\frac{l_{a-1}}{\\lambda^a}.\n\\tag{5.20}\\] Using that \\(F_{a-1} = b_{a} S_{a-1}\\) and \\(S_{a-1}l_{a-1}=l_a\\) we can rewrite this equation as \\[\n1 = \\sum_{a=1}^\\infty b_a \\,l_a\\,\\lambda^{-a} =:\\psi(\\lambda).\n\\tag{5.21}\\] This is the Euler-Lotka equation for the population growth factor \\(\\lambda\\) in the stable age distribution. Once we have solved it to determine \\(\\lambda\\), we can use Eq. 5.17 to determine the stable age distribution, \\[\nN_{a,t} = \\lambda^{t-a}l_{a} N_{0,0}.\n\\tag{5.22}\\] Unfortunately solving the Euler-Lotka equation analytically is normally not feasible. You will however find a solvable example in Exercise 5.1 below.\n\n\n5.1.4 Condition for extinction\nLuckily we do not need to solve the Euler-Lotka equation in order to determine whether the population grows or goes extinct. We note that \\[\n\\psi(1)=\\sum_{a=1}^\\infty b_a \\,l_a\n\\tag{5.23}\\] is the expected number of offspring produced by an individual during its lifetime. This quantity is known as the reproductive number (or net reproductive rate). If this reproductive number is greater than \\(1\\), then the population grows exponentially. If it is less than \\(1\\), then the population goes extinct. The way to see this from the Euler-Lotka equation Eq. 5.32 is to note that \\(\\psi(\\lambda)\\) is a decreasing function of \\(\\lambda\\). This means that there is a unique solution \\(\\lambda\\) to the Euler-Lotka equation and\n\nIf \\(\\psi(1)&gt;1\\), then \\(\\psi(\\lambda)=1\\) implies that \\(\\lambda&gt;1\\);\nIf \\(\\psi(1)&lt;1\\), then \\(\\psi(\\lambda)=1\\) implies that \\(\\lambda&lt;1\\).\n\n\n\nExercise 5.1 (Spotted owl) For the spotted owl the age-dependent reproduction numbers are \\[\nb_a = \\begin{cases}\n0 & \\text{if } a &lt; 2, \\\\\nb & \\text{if } a \\geq 2\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{5.24}\\] for some constant \\(b\\). The age-dependent survival probabilities are \\[\nS_a = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } a = 0, \\\\\nl & \\text{if } a = 1, \\\\\np & \\text{if } a &gt; 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{5.25}\\] for some constants \\(l\\) and \\(p\\).\n\nDetermine the probability that an individual survives from birth up to at least age \\(a\\).\nDetermine the expected number of offspring produced by a single individual during their lifetime.\nGive the condition on \\(b\\) for the population to be able to persist.\nDetermine the long-term growth factor of the population.\nDetermine the stable age distribution of the population.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.5 Solution of the Leslie matrix equation\nThe Leslie matrix equation Eq. 5.6 is a homogeneous linear difference equation with constant coefficients (the Leslie matrix \\(L\\) does not depend on time). You know from earlier modules that when confronted with a homogeneous linear differential equation with constant coefficients you can solve it with an exponential Ansatz. The same works for linear difference equations.\nSolving the Leslie matrix equation will give us another route to understanding the stable age distribution and the condition for extinction or survival of the population.\nWe make the Ansatz \\[\n\\mathbf{N}_t = \\lambda^t \\mathbf{v}\n\\tag{5.26}\\] and substitute it into Eq. 5.6. This gives \\[\n\\lambda^{t+1} \\mathbf{v} = L \\lambda^t \\mathbf{v}.\n\\tag{5.27}\\] Dividing by \\(\\lambda^t\\) gives \\[\n\\lambda \\mathbf{v} = L \\mathbf{v}.\n\\tag{5.28}\\] This means that our Ansatz works if we choose \\(\\lambda\\) to be an eigenvalue of the Leslie matrix \\(L\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) to be the corresponding eigenvector.\nIn the case where all eigenvalues of the Leslie matrix are distinct1, the general solution is the linear combination of the solutions for each eigenvalue. \\[\n\\mathbf{N}_t = c_1 \\lambda_1^t \\mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \\lambda_2^t \\mathbf{v}_2 + \\cdots + c_m \\lambda_m^t \\mathbf{v}_m,\n\\tag{5.29}\\] where \\(\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2,\\ldots,\\lambda_m\\) are the eigenvalues of the Leslie matrix and \\(\\mathbf{v}_1,\\mathbf{v}_2,\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_m\\) are the corresponding eigenvectors. The constants \\(c_1,c_2,\\ldots,c_m\\) are determined by the eigenvector expansion of the initial values \\(\\mathbf{N}_0\\): \\[\n\\mathbf{N}_0 = c_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \\mathbf{v}_2 + \\cdots + c_m \\mathbf{v}_m.\n\\tag{5.30}\\]\nWe can now look at the long-term fate of the population. If the Leslie matrix has a unique dominant eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_*\\) (such that the magnitude of \\(\\lambda_*\\) is greater than that of all other eigenvalues) with a corresponding eigenvector \\(\\mathbf{v}_*\\), then \\[\n\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\mathbf{N}_t}{\\lambda_*^t} = c_* \\mathbf{v}_*,\n\\tag{5.31}\\] where \\(c_*\\) is the coefficient of \\(\\mathbf{v}_*\\) in the eigenvector expansion of \\(\\mathbf{N}_0\\). This means that the population converges to a stable age distribution, given by the eigenvector corresponding to the dominant eigenvalue of the Leslie matrix.\nLuckily, there is a theorem about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of non-negative matrices that we can use to determine whether a Leslie matrix has a unique dominant eigenvalue.\n\nDefinition 5.1 We call the Leslie matrix irreducible if its Leslie graph is strongly connected, which means that there is a directed path from any node to any other node.\n\n\nDefinition 5.2 We call the Leslie matrix primitive if the greatest common divisor of the lengths of all circuits in the Leslie graph is \\(1\\).\n\n\nTheorem 5.1 If the Leslie matrix is irreducible and primitive, then it has a unique dominant eigenvalue that is real and positive. The corresponding right eigenvector is real and strictly positive.\n\nThis is a special case of the Perron-Frobenius theorem, which is a general theorem about non-negative matrices, and is used extensively in the theory of Markov chains. The above theorem is exactly what we need, because it tells us when the Leslie matrix has a unique dominant eigenvalue and a corresponding eigenvector that gives the stable age distribution.\n\nExample 5.1 continued\nWe return to Example 5.1. The Leslie graph is shown in Figure 5.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Leslie graph for Example 5.1.\n\n\n\nIt is irreducible and primitive, so we expect there to be a unique dominant eigenvalue. Let us verify this. The eigenvalues are the solutions of the characteristic equation \\[\n\\begin{split}\n0&=\\det(L-\\lambda I)=\\begin{vmatrix}\n-\\lambda & 1/2 & 1 \\\\\n1 & -\\lambda & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1/2 & -\\lambda\n\\end{vmatrix}\n= -\\lambda^3 + \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda+\\frac12\\\\\n&= (1-\\lambda)\\left(\\lambda^2+\\lambda+\\frac12\\right)\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{5.32}\\] We can read off that the solutions are \\[\n\\lambda_0 = 1, \\quad \\lambda_\\pm = -\\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\frac{1}{2}i.\n\\tag{5.33}\\] Because the magnitude of the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_\\pm\\) are less than \\(1\\), we have that \\(\\lambda_0\\) is the dominant eigenvalue and that \\(\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\lambda_\\pm^t=0\\). This means that the stable age distribution is given by the eigenvector \\(\\mathbf{v}_0\\) corresponding to the eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_0=1\\). And indeed \\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1/2 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1/2 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4 \\\\\n4 \\\\\n2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4 \\\\\n4 \\\\\n2\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\tag{5.34}\\] This confirms our numerical result from Eq. 5.19.\nThe convergence to this stable age distribution happens regardless of the initial age distribution.\n\n\n\n5.1.6 Exercises\n\nExercise 5.2 (* Fibonacci population) Consider a population in which individuals on average produce one offspring when they turn 1 year old and another offspring when they turn 2 years old. After that they die. Assume that there is no mortality before they turn 2 year old.\n\nFormulate the above information in terms of values for the reproduction numbers \\(b_a\\) and the survival probabilities \\(S_a\\).\nWrite down the Leslie matrix for this population.\nAssume that at \\(t=0\\) we start with 1 individual of age 0.

Use the Leslie matrix to calculate the numbers of individuals of ages \\(0,1,2\\) at times \\(t=1,2,3\\). What will happen in the long run? Will the population evolve towards a stable age distribution?\nDraw the graph associated with the Leslie matrix and determine whether the Leslie matrix is irreducible and primitive.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5.4 (Eastern Screech Owl) This exercise is most suitable for you if you are willing to use a computer to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices.\nThe Eastern Screech Owl is a small owl that is found in the eastern United States and Canada. It is a cavity-nesting bird, which means that it nests in holes in trees. It is able to adapt to diverse habitats, including wooded residential neighbourhoods and parks in suburban areas. In suburban areas, these owls find a variety of nesting opportunities, such as tree cavities, nest boxes, and even abandoned buildings, which may be less available in intensively farmed rural areas or dense forests. Additionally, the suburban settings can offer a rich supply of prey, including insects, small mammals, and other small creatures, partly due to the lower prevalence of large predators.\nBelow is a life table collected for two different habitats, suburban and rural, in Texas.\n\n\n\nAge\nSuburban\n\nRural\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(a\\)\n\\(l_a\\)\n\\(b_a\\)\n\\(l_a\\)\n\\(b_a\\)\n\n\n—\n————\n———\n————\n———\n\n\n1\n0.49\n0.8\n0.30\n0.8\n\n\n2\n0.18\n1.3\n0.11\n1.1\n\n\n3\n0.10\n1.5\n0.06\n1.6\n\n\n4\n0.06\n1.6\n0.04\n1.0\n\n\n5\n0.04\n1.3\n0.02\n1.0\n\n\n6\n0.03\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n7\n0.02\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n8\n0.02\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n9\n0.01\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n10\n0.01\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each of the two populations do the following:\n\nCalculate the reproductive number, i.e., the expected number of offspring produced by a single individual during its lifetime.\nCalculate the Leslie matrix.

    "section": "5.2 Continuous time model",
    "text": "5.2 Continuous time model\nOf course in the real world, time and age are not discrete variables and the population is not structured by age classes. This was only a simplification to make the model more tractable in the case where there is a clear annual cycle of reproduction. If we want to describe a species where individuals are born throughout the year and age continuously, it is more natural to use a continuous-time model.\n\n5.2.1 Model description\nWe now describe the population by the density \\(n(t,a)\\) of individuals at age \\(a\\). The total number \\(N(t)\\) of individuals in the population is then given by the integral of \\(n(t,a)\\) over all ages. More generally, the total number of individuals in the population that are between age \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\) is given by the integral of \\(n(t,a)\\) over the interval \\([a_1,a_2]\\). This is illustrated in Figure 5.4. You are familiar with the concept of density from probability theory, where continuous random variables are described by a probability density rather than a probability. You may also be familiar with the concept from physics, where the density of a material describes how the mass is distributed over space. Here, the density \\(n(t,a)\\) describes how the individuals are distributed over ages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: A sketch of a population density. The number of individuals in an age range is given by the area under the curve.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo derive the PDE for the age-structured population density, we consider how the density changes over an infinitesimal time interval \\(\\delta t\\) due to deaths: \\[\nn(t+\\delta t, a+\\delta t) = n(t,a) - \\mu(a) n(t,a) \\delta t.\n\\tag{5.34}\\] Note how we had to take into account that over the time interval \\(\\delta t\\) the age of the individuals has increased by \\(\\delta t\\). We now Taylor-expand the left-hand side around \\(t\\) and \\(a\\): \\[\nn(t+\\delta t, a+\\delta t) = n(t,a) + \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} \\delta t + \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial a} \\delta t + \\mathcal{O}(\\delta t^2).\n\\tag{5.35}\\] Cancelling the \\(n(t,a)\\) terms on both sides, dividing by \\(\\delta t\\) and taking the limit \\(\\delta t\\to 0\\) gives us the PDE for the age-structured population density: \\[\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial a} = -\\mu(a) n.\n\\tag{5.36}\\]\nThis equation is known as the McKendrick-von Foerster equation. It captures the effect of individuals ageing and dying, but it does not capture how they are born. Individuals are born with age \\(0\\). These offspring can be produced by parents of any ages, but with an age-dependent rate \\(b(a)\\). This gives \\[\nn(t,0) = \\int_0^\\infty b(a) n(t,a) \\, da.\n\\tag{5.37}\\] This is a boundary condition for the PDE. It says that the density of individuals at age \\(0\\) is given by the total rate at which offspring are produced by the individuals of all ages. This is the continuous-time version of Eq. 5.2, but note that now \\(n(t,0)\\) is a density and \\(b(a)\\) is a rate, whereas in the discrete-time model \\(N_{0,t}\\) is a number and \\(b_a\\) is a number.\n\n\n5.2.2 Stable age distribution\nWe will now solve the PDE for the age-structured population density by the method of separation of variables. We will make the Ansatz \\(n(t,a) = f(t) r(a)\\). This is a solution where the age distribution \\(r(a)\\) stays stable but the total population number varies with time according to \\(f(t)\\). You have seen this trick for finding solutions of linear, homogeneous PDEs in other modules, for example when you solved the wave equation. Substituting this Ansatz into the PDE gives \\[\nf'(t) r(a) + f(t) r'(a) = -\\mu(a) f(t) r(a).\n\\tag{5.38}\\] Dividing by \\(f(t) r(a)\\) gives \\[\n\\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)} + \\frac{r'(a)}{r(a)} = -\\mu(a).\n\\tag{5.39}\\] We now collect all terms that depend on \\(t\\) on the left-hand side and all terms that depend on \\(a\\) on the right-hand side: \\[\n\\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)} = - \\frac{r'(a)}{r(a)} - \\mu(a).\n\\tag{5.40}\\] Because the left-hand side is independent of \\(a\\) and the right-hand side is independent of \\(t\\), both sides must be equal to a constant. We introduce the separation constant \\(\\gamma\\) and write \\[\n\\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)} = \\gamma, \\quad \\frac{r'(a)}{r(a)} = -\\gamma - \\mu(a).\n\\tag{5.41}\\] These are now linear ODEs and hence easy to solve. The first ODE has the solution \\[\nf(t) = f(0) e^{\\gamma t}\n\\tag{5.42}\\] and the second ODE has the solution \\[\nr(a) = r(0) \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^a \\mu(a') \\, da'-\\gamma a\\right).\n\\tag{5.43}\\] The factor \\[\n\\exp\\left(-\\int_0^a \\mu(a') \\, da'\\right)=:l(a)\n\\tag{5.44}\\] is the probability that an individual survives up to age \\(a\\). This is the continuous-time version of Eq. 5.18. So altogether we have the population density \\[\nn(t,a) = n(0,0) l(a) e^{\\gamma (t-a)} ,\n\\tag{5.45}\\] where \\(n(0,0)=f(0)r(0)\\) is the initial density of individuals at age \\(0\\). This is the continuous-time version of Eq. 5.17.\nSo far we don’t yet know the value of the separation constant \\(\\gamma\\). This will be determined by the boundary condition. If we substitute the solution Eq. 5.45 into the boundary condition Eq. 5.37, we get \\[\nn(0,0)e^{\\gamma t} = \\int_0^\\infty b(a) n(0,0)l(a)e^{\\gamma (t-a)} \\, da.\n\\tag{5.46}\\] We can cancel the common factor \\(n(0,0)e^{\\gamma t}\\) on both sides to get the condition \\[\n1= \\int_0^\\infty b(a) l(a)e^{-\\gamma a} \\, da =: \\phi(\\gamma).\n\\tag{5.47}\\] We have introduced the shorthand notation \\(\\phi(\\gamma)\\) for the integral on the right-hand side. The condition Eq. 5.47 is the continuous-time version of the Euler-Lotka equation Eq. 5.31. It is a transcendental equation for \\(\\gamma\\), so we cannot solve it analytically for \\(\\gamma\\).\n\n\n5.2.3 Condition for extinction\nLuckily we do not need to solve the integral equation Eq. 5.47 to determine whether the population grows or goes extinct. We note that \\[\n\\phi(0)=\\int_0^\\infty b(a) l(a) \\, da=:R\n\\tag{5.48}\\] is the expected number of offspring produced by an individual during its lifetime. This quantity is known as the reproductive number. If this reproductive number is greater than \\(1\\), then the population grows exponentially. If it is less than \\(1\\), then the population goes extinct. The way to see this from the Euler-Lotka equation is to note that \\(\\phi(\\gamma)\\) is a decreasing function of \\(\\gamma\\). This means that there is a unique solution \\(\\gamma\\) to the Euler-Lotka equation Eq. 5.47 and\n\nIf \\(R &gt; 1\\), then \\(\\phi(\\gamma)=1\\) implies that \\(\\gamma &gt; 0\\) and the population grows exponentially.\nIf \\(R &lt; 1\\), then \\(\\phi(\\gamma)=1\\) implies that \\(\\gamma &lt; 0\\) and the population goes extinct.\n\nYou will notice the close analogy to the discussion of extinction in the discrete-time model in #sec-extinction-discrete.\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Exercises\n\nExercise 5.5 (* Age-independent rates) In the continuous-time age-structured population model consider the case where \\(b(a)=b\\) and \\(\\mu(a)=\\mu\\) are both constant. Repeat all steps of the analysis but simplifying the expressions at each step by using the constant values for birth and death rates.\n\nSolve the partial differential equation of the age-structured model by making the Ansatz \\(n(t,a)=f(t)r(a)\\) and introducing the separation constant \\(\\gamma\\).\nUse the boundary condition at \\(a=0\\) to determine the value of \\(\\gamma\\).\nGive the condition under which the population goes extinct and compare it to the condition in the exponential model from chapter 1.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5.6 (Seasonal mortality) Consider an age-structured population model in which, in addition to an age-dependent mortality, there is also a seasonal mortality. The population is described by a function \\(n(t,a)\\) giving the density of individuals of age \\(a\\) at time \\(t\\) which satisfies the equations \\[\n\\partial_t n(t,a)+\\partial_a n(t,a)=-(\\mu(a)+m(t))\\,n(t,a),\n\\tag{5.49}\\] \\[\nn(t,0) = \\int_0^\\infty b(a) n(t,a) da.\n\\tag{5.50}\\] The birth rate \\(b(a)\\) and the mortality rates \\(\\mu(a)\\) and \\(m(t)\\) are all positive.\n\nBy substituting the Ansatz \\(n(t,a)=p(t)r(a)\\) into equation Eq. 5.49 and separating variables with a separation constant \\(\\gamma\\), derive solutions for \\(p(t)\\) and \\(r(a)\\) and hence for \\(n(t,a)\\), involving \\(\\gamma\\).\nBy substituting your solution from part (a) into equation Eq. 5.50, derive an equation for \\(\\gamma\\). Write this in the form \\(\\phi(\\gamma)=1\\) for some function \\(\\phi\\). Show that this \\(\\phi\\) is a monotonic function.\nAssume that the seasonal mortality rate \\(m(t)\\) is periodic with period \\(1\\) and denote by \\(F\\) the averaged seasonal mortality. By considering the population at the end of each season, show that the population will go extinct if \\(\\gamma &lt;F\\).\nExplain how you can use a property of the function \\(\\phi\\) to eliminate \\(\\gamma\\) from the condition for extinction. Thus finally give the condition for extinction in terms of \\(b(a), \\mu(a)\\) and \\(F\\).",

This division represents the most basic form of demographic structure in a population. We again describe them by differential equations that capture that the numbers can decrease due to deaths and increase due to births. \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\frac{dF}{dt} &= -\\mu_F F + b_F\\,\\varphi(F,M)\\\\\n\\frac{dM}{dt} &= -\\mu_M M + b_M\\,\\varphi(F,M).\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{4.1}\\] Here \\(\\mu_F\\) and \\(\\mu_M\\) are the death rates of females and males respectively, which are examples of sex-specific vital rates.

In particular, if we start with equal number females and males then the they will stay equal for all times.\nTo make further progress we need to make a concrete choice for the function \\(\\varphi(F,M)\\). We will consider the choice \\[\n\\varphi(F,M)=F\\,M.\n\\tag{4.5}\\] This choice is motivated by the fact that both a male and a female is needed to produce offspring. Also the rate of births should increase if there are more females but also when there are more males.\nA simple thing to note is that if \\(M(0)=0\\) then \\(M(t)=0\\) for all times.

    "section": "5.1 Discrete time model",
    "text": "5.1 Discrete time model\nAs we discussed in Chapter 2, a discrete-time model is the natural choice if reproduction is an annual event, taking place in a short breeding season for example. We will now introduce a discrete-time age-structured population model. We will derive the model and then study the long-term behaviour of the population and its age distribution.\n\n5.1.1 Model description\nBoth time and age will be discrete variables. We will take them to be integers counting years. We will describe the population by the numbers \\(N_{a,t}\\) of individuals of age \\(a\\) at time \\(t\\), with \\(a\\) and \\(t\\) both integers and \\(a\\geq 0\\). The total number \\(N_t\\) of individuals in the population at time \\(t\\) is then given by the sum of \\(N_{a,t}\\) over all ages.\nThe parameters of our model will be the probabilities \\(S_a\\) of surviving from age \\(a\\) to age \\(a+1\\) and the number of offspring \\(b_a\\) produced by an individual when they reach age \\(a\\). Because the number of individuals at age \\(a\\) at time \\(t+1\\) is the number of individuals that a year earlier were at age \\(a-1\\) and have survived to age \\(a\\), we have \\[\nN_{a,t+1} = S_{a-1} N_{a-1,t}\n\\tag{5.1}\\] for \\(a=1,2,\\dots\\).\nWhen individuals reach age \\(a\\), they each produce \\(b_a\\) offspring. The total number of offspring produced at time \\(t\\) is therefore obtained by summing over all ages \\(a\\) the number of individuals at age \\(a\\) at time \\(t\\) times the number of offspring produced by an individual of age \\(a\\): \\[\nN_{0,t} = \\sum_{a=1}^\\infty b_a N_{a,t}.\n\\tag{5.2}\\]\nIn Eq. 5.2 both sides of the equation are at time \\(t\\). That is because reproduction is taken to happen instantaneously at the start of year \\(t\\). It is conventional to use Eq. 5.1 to rewrite Eq. 5.2 as an equation for \\(N_{0,t+1}\\): \\[\nN_{0,t+1} = \\sum_{a=1}^\\infty b_a N_{a,t+1}= \\sum_{a=1}^\\infty b_a S_{a-1} N_{a-1,t}\n= \\sum_{a=1}^\\infty F_{a-1} N_{a-1,t},\n\\tag{5.3}\\] where we have introduced the fecundity \\[\nF_a:=b_{a+1} S_{a}.\n\\]\nEq. 5.1 and Eq. 5.3 are the equations for the discrete-time age-structured population model. They are a system of coupled difference equations, one equation for each age class. Let us write them out again more explicitly: \\[\n\\begin{split}\nN_{0,t+1}&=F_0 N_{0,t}+F_1N_{1,t}+\\cdots +F_{m-1}N_{m-1}+F_{m}N_{m}+\\cdots, \\\\\nN_{1,t+1}&=S_0 N_{0,t}, \\\\\nN_{2,t+1}&=S_1 N_{1,t}, \\\\\n&\\vdots \\\\\nN_{m-1,t+1}&=S_{m-2} N_{m-2,t}, \\\\\nN_{m,t+1}&=S_{m-1} N_{m-1,t}, \\\\\n&\\vdots\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{5.4}\\] Annoyingly, the equation for \\(N_{0,t+1}\\) couples all these infinitely many equations together. We would like to solve these coupled equations to determine the numbers \\(N_{a,t}\\) of individuals at each age at each time, given the initial numbers \\(N_{a,0}\\) for all ages \\(a\\) at time \\(t=0\\). This can generally not be done analytically.\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Leslie matrix\nSo far we have dealt with an infinite set of age classes. However there are two situations where we can reduce the infinite set of equations Eq. 5.4 to a finite set. In those cases we can rewrite the equations in matrix form and analyse them using matrix algebra.\nThe first situation where only a finite number of equations is coupled together is when there is a maximal age \\(m\\) beyond which there is no reproduction, either because \\(b_a = 0\\) for \\(a&gt;m\\) or because there are no older individuals because \\(S_{m} = 0\\). In this case we can collect the equations for \\(N_{a,t+1}\\) for \\(a=0,1,2,\\ldots,m-1\\) into the matrix equation \\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nN_{0} \\\\\nN_{1} \\\\\nN_{2} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nN_{m-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}_{t+1}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nF_0 & F_1 & \\cdots & F_{m-2} & F_{m-1} \\\\\nS_0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & S_1 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\cdots & S_{m-2} & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nN_{0} \\\\\nN_{1} \\\\\nN_{2} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nN_{m-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}_{t}.\n\\tag{5.5}\\] The matrix on the right-hand side is called the Leslie matrix.\nWe can represent this Leslie matrix with the directed graph in Figure 5.1. The graph has one node for each age class \\(a=0,1,2,\\ldots,m-1\\) and a directed edge from node \\(i\\) to node \\(j\\) if and only if the Leslie matrix has a non-zero entry in column \\(i\\) and row \\(j\\). The graph is called the Leslie graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Leslie graph when there is no reproduction from ages greater than \\(m\\).\n\n\n\nNote that we did not need to include the age class \\(m\\) because it is not needed to calculate the reproduction because \\(F_m=b_{m+1}S_{m}=0\\). Once the matrix equation Eq. 5.5 is solved, we can determine \\(N_{m,t+1}\\) separately from Eq. 5.1 if we are interested, and similarly for all older age classes that do not reproduce, if any.\nLet us denote the Leslie matrix by \\(L\\). The equations Eq. 5.5 and Eq. 5.12 are matrix equations of the form \\[\n\\mathbf{N}_{t+1} = L\\, \\mathbf{N}_t,\n\\tag{5.6}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{N}_t\\) is the column vector of the numbers \\(N_{a,t}\\) and \\(L\\) is the Leslie matrix.\n\n\nExample 5.1 Consider a population with the reproduction numbers \\(b_a\\) and the survival probabilities \\(S_a\\) given in the following table:\n\n\n\n\\(a\\)\n\\(b_a\\)\n\\(S_a\\)\n\\(F_a\\)\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n1\n0\n1/2\n1/2\n\n\n2\n1\n1/2\n1\n\n\n3\n2\n1/2\n0\n\n\n4\n0\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\n\n5\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\\(\\vdots\\)\n\n\n\nThe final column in that table is calculated from the previous ones using \\(F_a:=b_{a+1}S_{a}\\). In this example the maximum age \\(m\\) beyond which there is no reproduction is \\(m=3\\). Hence the corresponding Leslie matrix is a \\(3\\times 3\\) matrix. It is given by \\[\nL = \\begin{pmatrix}\nF_0&F_1&F_2 \\\\\nS_0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & S_1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1/2 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1/2 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\tag{5.7}\\]\nAssume that the at time \\(t=0\\) we only have 10 individuals all of age 0, i.e., \\[\n\\mathbf{N}_0 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n10 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\tag{5.8}\\] We can then calculate the numbers at the following times \\(t=1,2,3,\\ldots\\) by repeated multiplication by the Leslie matrix \\(L\\): \\[\n\\mathbf{N}_1 = L \\mathbf{N}_0 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1/2 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1/2 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n10 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n10 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\] \\[\n\\mathbf{N}_2 = L \\mathbf{N}_1\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n5 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n5\n\\end{pmatrix},\n~~~\n\\mathbf{N}_3 = L \\mathbf{N}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n5 \\\\\n5 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\cdots.\n\\tag{5.9}\\] Continuing like this (using a computer) we observe that the population converges to a stable age distribution. \\[\n\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\mathbf{N}_t = \\begin{pmatrix}\n4 \\\\\n4 \\\\\n2\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\tag{5.10}\\] This means that the population will eventually consist of \\(4\\) individuals of age \\(0\\), \\(4\\) individuals of age \\(1\\), and \\(2\\) individuals of age \\(2\\). We can calculate the number of older individuals as follows \\(N_{3,t} = S_2 N_{2,t} = 1, N_{4,t}=S_3N_{3,t}=1/2,\\cdots\\) as \\(t\\to\\infty\\).\n\n\nThe other situation where we only need a finite number of age classes is where the survival probabilities and the reproduction numbers are constant for all ages above a certain age \\(m-1\\). We can then collapse all individuals of age \\(m\\) or larger into the same age class \\(m\\). The survivors from age class \\(m\\) are thus put back into the same age class \\(m\\). This modifies the equation for \\(N_{m,t+1}\\) to \\[\nN_{m,t+1} = S_{m-1} N_{m-1,t} + S_{m} N_{m,t}.\n\\tag{5.11}\\] In this case we can write the model as a matrix equation of the form \\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nN_{0} \\\\\nN_{1} \\\\\nN_{2} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nN_{m}\n\\end{pmatrix}_{t+1}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nF_0 & F_1 & \\cdots & F_{m-1} & F_{m} \\\\\nS_0 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & S_1 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\cdots & S_{m-1} & S_m\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nN_{0} \\\\\nN_{1} \\\\\nN_{2} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nN_{m}\n\\end{pmatrix}_{t}.\n\\tag{5.12}\\] Now \\(N_{m,t}\\) is the number of all individuals of age \\(m\\) or older at time \\(t\\). We can represent this Leslie matrix with the graph in Figure 5.2 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Leslie graph when the last age class contains all individuals with age \\(\\geq m\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Stable age distribution\nThe phenomenon that we observed in Example 5.1 that the age distribution settles down to a stable age distribution as time goes on is a general phenomenon. To understand it we will now look for a solution such that \\[\nN_{a,t+1} = \\lambda N_{a,t}\n\\tag{5.13}\\] This is a solution in which the age distribution remains stable from one year to the next, but the total population grows or shrinks by a factor \\(\\lambda\\) each year. It was untypical that in Example 5.1 we had \\(\\lambda=1\\) so that the population neither grew nor shrank.\nFor \\(a=1\\) Eq. 5.13 gives \\[\nN_{1,t+1} = \\lambda N_{1,t} = S_0 N_{0,t}\n\\tag{5.14}\\] and hence \\[\nN_{1,t} = \\frac{S_0}{\\lambda} N_{0,t}.\n\\tag{5.15}\\] Similarly we can express \\(N_{2,t}\\) in terms of \\(N_{0,t}\\): \\[\nN_{2,t} = \\frac{S_1}{\\lambda} N_{1,t} = \\frac{S_1 S_0}{\\lambda^2} N_{0,t}.\n\\tag{5.16}\\] We can continue this process to express \\(N_{a,t}\\) in terms of \\(N_{0,t}\\): \\[\nN_{a,t} = \\frac{S_{a-1}S_{a-2}\\cdots S_0}{\\lambda^a} N_{0,t}= \\frac{l_{a}}{\\lambda^a} N_{0,t}\n\\tag{5.17}\\] where \\[\nl_a:=S_{a-1}S_{a-2}\\cdots S_0.\n\\tag{5.18}\\] is the probability of surviving from age \\(0\\) to age \\(a\\).\nSubstituting Eq. 5.17 into Eq. 5.2 for the newborns gives \\[\nN_{0,t} = \\sum_{a=1}^\\infty b_{a} N_{a,t} = \\sum_{a=1}^\\infty b_{a} \\frac{l_{a}}{\\lambda^{a}} N_{0,t}.\n\\tag{5.19}\\] Dividing the equation by \\(N_{0,t}\\) gives \\[\n1 = \\sum_{a=1}^\\infty b_a \\,l_a\\,\\lambda^{-a} =:\\psi(\\lambda).\n\\tag{5.20}\\] This is the Euler-Lotka equation for the population growth factor \\(\\lambda\\) in the stable age distribution. Once we have solved it to determine \\(\\lambda\\), we can use Eq. 5.13 to determine the stable age distribution, \\[\nN_{a,t} = \\lambda^{t-a}l_{a} N_{0,0}.\n\\tag{5.21}\\] Unfortunately solving the Euler-Lotka equation analytically is normally not feasible. You will however find a solvable example in Exercise 5.1 below.\n\n\n5.1.4 Condition for extinction\nLuckily we do not need to solve the Euler-Lotka equation in order to determine whether the population grows or goes extinct. We note that \\[\n\\psi(1)=\\sum_{a=1}^\\infty b_a \\,l_a=:R\n\\tag{5.22}\\] is the expected number of offspring produced by an individual during its lifetime. This quantity is known as the reproductive number. If this reproductive number is greater than \\(1\\), then the population grows exponentially. If it is less than \\(1\\), then the population goes extinct. The way to see this from the Euler-Lotka equation Eq. 5.31 is to note that \\(\\psi(\\lambda)\\) is a decreasing function of \\(\\lambda\\). This means that there is a unique solution \\(\\lambda\\) to the Euler-Lotka equation and\n\nIf \\(R&gt;1\\) then \\(\\lambda&gt;1\\) and population grows exponentially;\nIf \\(R&lt;1\\) then \\(\\lambda&lt;1\\) and population goes extinct.\n\n\n\nExercise 5.1 (Spotted owl) For the spotted owl the age-dependent reproduction numbers are \\[\nb_a = \\begin{cases}\n0 & \\text{if } a &lt; 2, \\\\\nb & \\text{if } a \\geq 2\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{5.23}\\] for some constant \\(b\\). The age-dependent survival probabilities are \\[\nS_a = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } a = 0, \\\\\nl & \\text{if } a = 1, \\\\\np & \\text{if } a &gt; 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{5.24}\\] for some constants \\(l\\) and \\(p\\).\n\nDetermine the probability that an individual survives from birth up to at least age \\(a\\).\nDetermine the expected number of offspring produced by a single individual during their lifetime.\nGive the condition on \\(b\\) for the population to be able to persist.\nDetermine the long-term growth factor of the population.\nDetermine the stable age distribution of the population.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.5 Solving the Leslie equation\nThe Leslie matrix equation Eq. 5.6 is a homogeneous linear difference equation with constant coefficients (the Leslie matrix \\(L\\) does not depend on time). You know from earlier modules that when confronted with a homogeneous linear differential equation with constant coefficients you can solve it with an exponential Ansatz. The same works for linear difference equations.\nSolving the Leslie matrix equation will give us another route to understanding the stable age distribution and the condition for extinction or survival of the population.\nWe make the Ansatz \\[\n\\mathbf{N}_t = \\lambda^t \\mathbf{v}\n\\tag{5.25}\\] and substitute it into Eq. 5.6. This gives \\[\n\\lambda^{t+1} \\mathbf{v} = L \\lambda^t \\mathbf{v}.\n\\tag{5.26}\\] Dividing by \\(\\lambda^t\\) gives \\[\n\\lambda \\mathbf{v} = L \\mathbf{v}.\n\\tag{5.27}\\] This means that our Ansatz works if we choose \\(\\lambda\\) to be an eigenvalue of the Leslie matrix \\(L\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) to be the corresponding eigenvector.\nIn the case where all eigenvalues of the Leslie matrix are distinct1, the general solution is the linear combination of the solutions for each eigenvalue. \\[\n\\mathbf{N}_t = c_1 \\lambda_1^t \\mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \\lambda_2^t \\mathbf{v}_2 + \\cdots + c_n \\lambda_n^t \\mathbf{v}_n,\n\\tag{5.28}\\] where \\(\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2,\\ldots,\\lambda_n\\) are the distinct eigenvalues of the Leslie matrix and \\(\\mathbf{v}_1,\\mathbf{v}_2,\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_n\\) are the corresponding eigenvectors. The constants \\(c_1,c_2,\\ldots,c_n\\) are determined by the eigenvector expansion of the initial values \\(\\mathbf{N}_0\\): \\[\n\\mathbf{N}_0 = c_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \\mathbf{v}_2 + \\cdots + c_n \\mathbf{v}_n.\n\\tag{5.29}\\]\nWe can now look at the long-term fate of the population. If the Leslie matrix has a unique dominant eigenvalue which we will denote \\(\\lambda_1\\) then by definition \\[\n|\\lambda_1| &gt; |\\lambda_2| \\geq |\\lambda_3| \\geq \\cdots \\geq |\\lambda_n|.\n\\] Then \\[\n\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\mathbf{N}_t}{\\lambda_1^t} = c_1 \\mathbf{v}_1.\n\\tag{5.30}\\] This means that the population converges to a stable age distribution, given by the eigenvector corresponding to the dominant eigenvalue of the Leslie matrix.\nLuckily, there is a theorem about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of non-negative matrices that we can use to determine whether a Leslie matrix has a unique dominant eigenvalue.\n\nDefinition 5.1 We call the Leslie matrix irreducible if its Leslie graph is strongly connected, which means that there is a directed path from any node to any other node.\n\n\nDefinition 5.2 We call the Leslie matrix primitive if the greatest common divisor of the lengths of all circuits in the Leslie graph is \\(1\\).\n\n\nTheorem 5.1 If the Leslie matrix is irreducible and primitive, then it has a unique dominant eigenvalue that is real and positive. The corresponding right eigenvector is real and strictly positive.\n\nThis is a special case of the Perron-Frobenius theorem, which is a general theorem about non-negative matrices, and is used extensively in the theory of Markov chains. The above theorem is exactly what we need, because it tells us when the Leslie matrix has a unique dominant eigenvalue and a corresponding eigenvector that gives the stable age distribution.\n\nExample 5.1 continued\nWe return to Example 5.1. The Leslie graph is shown in Figure 5.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Leslie graph for Example 5.1.\n\n\n\nIt is irreducible and primitive, so we expect there to be a unique dominant eigenvalue. Let us verify this. The eigenvalues are the solutions of the characteristic equation \\[\n\\begin{split}\n0&=\\det(L-\\lambda I)=\\begin{vmatrix}\n-\\lambda & 1/2 & 1 \\\\\n1 & -\\lambda & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1/2 & -\\lambda\n\\end{vmatrix}\n= -\\lambda^3 + \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda+\\frac12\\\\\n&= (1-\\lambda)\\left(\\lambda^2+\\lambda+\\frac12\\right)\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{5.31}\\] We can read off that the solutions are \\[\n\\lambda_1 = 1, \\quad \\lambda_\\pm = -\\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\frac{1}{2}i.\n\\tag{5.32}\\] Because the magnitude of the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_\\pm\\) are less than \\(1\\), we have that \\(\\lambda_1\\) is the dominant eigenvalue and that \\(\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\lambda_\\pm^t=0\\). This means that the stable age distribution is given by the eigenvector \\(\\mathbf{v}_1\\) corresponding to the eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_1=1\\). And indeed \\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1/2 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1/2 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4 \\\\\n4 \\\\\n2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4 \\\\\n4 \\\\\n2\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\tag{5.33}\\] This confirms our numerical result from Eq. 5.19.\nThe convergence to this stable age distribution happens regardless of the initial age distribution.\n\n\n\n5.1.6 Exercises\n\nExercise 5.2 (* Fibonacci population) Consider a population in which individuals on average produce one offspring when they turn 1 year old and another offspring when they turn 2 years old. After that they die. Assume that there is no mortality before they turn 2 year old.\n\nFormulate the above information in terms of values for the reproduction numbers \\(b_a\\) and the survival probabilities \\(S_a\\).\nWrite down the Leslie matrix for this population.\nAssume that at \\(t=0\\) we start with 1 individual of age 0. By hand, calculate the numbers of individuals at each age at time \\(t=1,2,3,4\\) and \\(5\\).\nUsing the Leslie matrix, calculate the stable age distribution and the long-term growth factor (the factor by which the total population changes from one year to the next).\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5.3 (Semelparous population) Consider a population in which individuals die after having given birth for the first time at age 3.

Will the population evolve towards a stable age distribution?\nDraw the graph associated with the Leslie matrix and determine whether the Leslie matrix is irreducible and primitive.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5.4 (Eastern Screech Owl) This exercise is most suitable for you if you are willing to use a computer to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices.\nThe Eastern Screech Owl is a small owl that is found in the eastern United States and Canada. It is a cavity-nesting bird, which means that it nests in holes in trees. It is able to adapt to diverse habitats, including wooded residential neighbourhoods and parks in suburban areas. In suburban areas, these owls find a variety of nesting opportunities, such as tree cavities, nest boxes, and even abandoned buildings, which may be less available in intensively farmed rural areas or dense forests. Additionally, the suburban settings can offer a rich supply of prey, including insects, small mammals, and other small creatures, partly due to the lower prevalence of large predators.\nBelow is a life table collected for two different habitats, suburban and rural, in Texas.\n\n\n\nAge\nSuburban\n\nRural\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(a\\)\n\\(l_a\\)\n\\(b_a\\)\n\\(l_a\\)\n\\(b_a\\)\n\n\n—\n————\n———\n————\n———\n\n\n1\n0.49\n0.8\n0.30\n0.8\n\n\n2\n0.18\n1.3\n0.11\n1.1\n\n\n3\n0.10\n1.5\n0.06\n1.6\n\n\n4\n0.06\n1.6\n0.04\n1.0\n\n\n5\n0.04\n1.3\n0.02\n1.0\n\n\n6\n0.03\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n7\n0.02\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n8\n0.02\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n9\n0.01\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n10\n0.01\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each of the two populations do the following:\n\nCalculate the reproductive number, i.e., the expected number of offspring produced by a single individual during its lifetime.\nCalculate the Leslie matrix.
